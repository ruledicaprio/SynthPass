## 1. SCOPE

Part 8 of Doc 9303 provides guidance on Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs). The purpose of this guidance material is to promote a consistent approach in the issuance of ETDs in order to:

- enhance the security of the document;
- protect the individual;
- promote greater confidence for border staff in handling ETDs at ports; and
- address the vulnerabilities presented by inconsistent practices and security features.

The guidance material covers travel documents issued by Issuing Authorities to travellers in distressed or unpredicted situations where it is not possible to issue a standard full-validity passport or travel document book and addresses the following areas:

- security/issuance;
- cost;
- format;
- validity;
- document title/name; and
- post-issuance.

This guidance material does not cover:

- standard full-validity passports delivered in emergency situations;
- standard passports delivered with limited validity;
- convention travel documents (which are covered under separate guidance on Issuing Machine Readable Convention Travel Documents for Refugees and Stateless Persons<sup>1</sup>), or "Laissez-passer" issued by the United Nations or the European Union; or
- travel documents issued by humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

However, it is intended that this guidance material can be used as a measure of best practice across all issuing organizations, such as humanitarian organizations who issue travel documents to stateless and displaced persons, and vulnerable migrants (including refugees and asylum seekers). Humanitarian organizations are encouraged to comply with its general principles to improve the standards and security of their documents.

Part 8 also specifies the use of visible digital seals in ETDs, an optional feature which if implemented, shall be encoded as specified in this part.

## 2. INTRODUCTION

### 2.1 What is an Emergency Travel Document (ETD)?

Emergency travel documents are issued by States to travellers needing to travel urgently in distressed or unpredicted situations where it is not possible to issue a standard full-validity passport.

Where the Issuing Authority considers that the person has a justified need to travel on urgent or compassionate grounds, a State may issue a specific type of document, commonly a passport-sized book (with fewer pages) or, depending on the circumstances outside the country of origin or in the country of issuance, a single sheet, with a restricted time and territorial validity, in order to facilitate scheduled travel back to the country of origin or to a named destination or to complete short-term travel.

The terminology used for documents issued in these situations is confusing, and various terms are used by different Issuing Authorities for the same document.

Some of the terms used are set out below, and it is not always clear what the specific term means:

- emergency passport;
- emergency travel document;
- emergency travel certificate;
- temporary passport;
- temporary travel document;
- provisional passport; and
- provisional travel document.

For the purposes of this guidance material, the term Emergency Travel Document (ETD) is used to describe this range of documents. This guidance material has been drafted to provide the flexibility for the Issuing Authority to determine the specific type of document to be issued (a limited-page passport-sized book or a single sheet), which can vary on a case-by-case basis.

It is noted that the majority of Issuing Authorities do not issue ETDs to refugees or stateless persons or to anyone who is not a citizen of their own State/Member State. However, in exceptional, crisis situations, ETDs may be issued, usually in the form of a laissez-passer. As part of the provision of humanitarian aid, organizations such as the ICRC issue travel documents to asylum seekers, refugees, vulnerable migrants, and displaced or stateless persons in emergency situations. Such travel documents are issued for a one-way journey and after the completion of visa and travel requirements. They are issued only as a last resort when Issuing Authorities are not in a position to issue a full-validity passport or travel document.

### 2.2 Problems arising from a lack of global standards or recommended best practices

A specific ETD in a uniform format<sup>2</sup> is issued by a number of Member States of the European Union to unrepresented EU citizens in third countries (i.e. EU citizens holding the nationality of a Member State which is not represented in a given third country), whose passports have been lost, stolen or destroyed or are temporarily unavailable. The document can be issued by any EU Member State under the authority of the Member State of nationality. It covers a single journey with a validity period barely longer than the minimum period required for completion of the journey for which it is issued. The purpose of the common-format EU ETD is to provide genuine assistance to unrepresented EU citizens in emergency situations in third countries. Some EU Member States issue their own national ETDs to unrepresented EU nationals for the same purpose.

However, there were no global standards or recommended practices for the issuance of ETDs. Annex 9 — *Facilitation* of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the "Chicago Convention"), provides an exemption for ETDs from ICAO minimum standards for MRTDs. As a result, varying standards are used by each individual Issuing Authority. There is no clear definition for ETDs, and they may have a lower security level attached to their deliverance. This can result in:

- ETDs being issued routinely as a (standard) document to travel, especially in the cases where countries have centralized the production and issuance of their national passports to the home country when an application is made overseas (as this process is easier);
- ETDs being targeted by potential fraudsters, considering the ETD's limited security level;
- Issuing Authorities being required to consider documentation that can be variable in terms of security and quality of issue; and
- other humanitarian organizations that issue travel documents (for example to stateless and displaced persons, or vulnerable migrants including refugees and asylum seekers) not having guidance on issuance or acceptance by which to improve the standards and security of their documents.

### 2.3 Terminology used

It is recognized that States often issue more than one type of ETD to fulfil varying operational and policy requirements, and the terminology varies considerably. It is also recognized that, as a consequence of specific arrangements, in some cases a single, common-format ETD is issued by a number of States to citizens of any other of the States participating in such arrangements (e.g. the common-format ETD issued to unrepresented citizens of the EU). Therefore, this guidance material should establish a single name to be used (see also section 4.5).

## 3. BACKGROUND

The Chicago Convention provides a mandate to develop and maintain Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs). The SARPs developed are a means of ensuring that inspection authorities have a satisfactory level of confidence in the reliability of travel documents and can use their equipment to process presented travel documents in a globally interoperable manner.

## 4. PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES

### 4.1 Security/Issuance

#### 4.1.1 Circumstances to issue ETDs

Travellers may find that they are unable to obtain standard full-validity passports but need nevertheless to travel urgently. The issuance of ETDs by an Issuing Authority may be considered in relation to but not be limited to the following situations:

- emergency situation for the individual traveller (for example, a family illness; death of a relative) with inadequate time to apply for a standard full-validity passport, including urgent travel needs while a standard full-validity passport has been lost, stolen or damaged/mutilated;
- emergency situation abroad (for example, a conflict or natural disaster such as a flood or earthquake) and a need to travel home;
- lost, stolen or damaged/mutilated passport while abroad;
- contingency arrangements if a standard full-validity passport cannot be issued in-country;
- deportation, removal, repatriation; and
- unrepresented foreign nationals who cannot access their own consular services in case of emergency or are in personal emergency situations (for example, when their documents are lost, stolen, destroyed or inaccessible).

The type of document issued in the above situations may not be the same in all cases. The traveller's situation and the individual circumstances of each case should be taken into account when an Issuing Authority determines which travel document is most appropriate. The criteria for issuing an ETD should be made available on request to the traveller.

ETDs are often issued in locations<sup>3</sup> abroad<sup>4</sup> where it is either impractical or inappropriate for an individual to apply for a standard full-validity passport.

Ultimately, the type of travel document issued is dependent on the individual circumstances, the environment surrounding its issuance, and the practices of an Issuing Authority. In most cases, the security of the document often reflects the circumstances under which the ETDs are issued and the access to facilities and technology available at the time.

---

<sup>3</sup> ETDs may be issued from a number of locations including but not limited to:  
Issuance overseas:  
i. from an embassy, high commission or honorary consul;  
ii. from a remote area in crisis, (e.g. mobile response unit) where the person issuing the documents must work in tandem with the person's home office to ensure that all required eligibility and security procedures are met;  
iii. from airports in crisis situations; and  
iv. from a designated embassy, high commission or honorary consul of other countries where a special arrangement is in place.  
Issuance domestically:  
i. from the airport; and  
ii. from an office of the Issuing Authority.

<sup>4</sup> There are examples of good practice whereby some States have special arrangements with partners to provide emergency services overseas through embassies, high commissions, honorary consuls or trusted third parties (private sector industry) in States where they do not have a presence. Although these partnerships are rare, this guidance material encourages States to explore this option on a bilateral basis.

---

#### 4.1.2 Issuance process of ETDs

The issuance process of ETDs should stay as close as possible to that for standard MRTDs. In line with the Annex 9 requirement for transparent processes, Issuing Authorities should define which steps of the issuance process can diverge, and under which circumstances. States of emergency may necessitate issuance of ETDs in less than ideal circumstances and at very short notice so it is important that issuing staff can be assured that they have the most robust process possible (given the circumstances). There may be different ways of achieving enhanced integrity in these situations:

- **Verification:** It is recommended that the issuers satisfy themselves that proper checks are carried out against Interpol or other national databases wherever possible. Travel documents are only as secure as the identity assurance processes behind their production and issuance.
- **Enrolment/Application:** It is recommended that details of the ETD application and of the document issued, are recorded on the applicant's file for future reference. It is important that even (or perhaps especially) in cases of manual issuance this information forms part of the applicant's case history.
- **Entitlement/Identity verification:** It is recommended that, where possible, States request supporting identification documents to assist them in their decision to issue an ETD. Additionally, where biometric verification/identification may be used to support identity verification processes, States should make use of this.
- **Linking to the standard full-validity passport:** Where a standard full-validity passport has previously been issued, it is recommended that States consider linking it to the ETD in order to establish the applicant's case history and provide further identity assurance. This practice will also help ensure that the document is taken out of circulation at the final destination State (see section 4.6 on "post-issuance"). An alert flag may be raised for first-time applicants, where no previous passport record exists. It is advisable to keep record of all travel documents, including any ETDs, over a determined period of time.
- **Informing the applicant:** It is recommended that applicants be informed of the need to apply for a standard full-validity passport should they wish to travel at a future date. Applicants should also be made aware that Issuing Authorities may retain their ETD on arriving at the destination, depending on whether it has been issued for one journey or more than one.

#### 4.1.3 Two types of ETDs

There are two possible options when Issuing Authorities face the need to issue an ETD. Either they consider delivering:

1. a (limited-page) passport-sized booklet; or
2. a single-sheet travel document (normally a stand-alone A4-sized paper sheet or a fold-out document).

The (limited-page) passport-sized booklet should be issued wherever possible and should comply with the relevant specifications in Doc 9303 relating to MRTDs. The advantages of issuing this type of booklet are:

- the booklet can be personalized in a more secure manner than a single-sheet document;
- it provides greater scope for inclusion of security features;
- it offers more reliability because the inclusion of a Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) will ensure that the document can be swiped through a passport reader and automatically checked against watch lists and other systems;
- it provides a broader acceptance/recognition level by other countries and international parties/entities; and
- it entitles the holder to a wider range of travel options (although limited, the passport-sized document offers a longer validity and more pages than the single-sheet travel document valid for one trip only).

In situations (for example, during a natural disaster or in a conflict situation) where it is not appropriate or practical to issue the (limited page) passport-sized MRTD booklet, it is also possible to produce/issue a single-sheet document. The advantages of issuing a single-sheet document in these types of situations are:

- it may be issued in crisis situations where facilities to personalize a book are inaccessible or unavailable;
- it may be quicker to personalize than the passport-sized book;
- it may be a more cost-effective option; and
- it will be subject to more scrutiny at borders.

#### 4.1.4 Principle

Given the de facto circumstances, the most secure document that can be issued should be issued.<sup>5</sup>

#### 4.1.5 Recommended best practice

- A machine readable ETD is the preferred standard, primary document.
- ETDs that exist in booklet form should have a limited number of pages (conform to its limited validity) and be consistent with the security features guidance contained in Doc 9303.
- **Effective 1 January 2026**, machine readable booklet ETDs issued with a secondary document code shall use the document code 'PE'. **Effective 1 January 2028**, all machine readable booklet ETDs shall be issued with the document code 'PE'. The secondary document code refers to the second letter of the document code.<sup>6</sup>
- States shall circulate specimen information to other States and concerned organizations such as airlines, including information on the design, security features and issuance procedures of ETDs.<sup>7</sup>
- States should define that no person should hold more than one valid ETD concurrently.
- An ETD should be issued as near to the date of travel as possible to ensure it is used for the specified purpose and exact journey for which it was issued.

In cases where an MRTD ETD is not issued, the single-sheet travel document shall be issued instead, noting that:

- Single-sheet ETDs should contain the minimum, basic security features, such as a watermark, security background printing or UV fluorescence ink or elements so as to counteract fraudsters' actions and to offer an adequate acceptance and recognition level.
- The inclusion of a machine readable zone is an optional feature which, if implemented, shall be consistent with the technical specifications contained in Doc 9303, including document codes identifying the document type. **Effective 1 January 2026**, machine readable single-sheet ETDs issued with a secondary document code shall use the document code 'PU'. **Effective 1 January 2028**, all machine readable single-sheet ETDs shall be issued with the document code 'PU'. The secondary document code refers to the second letter of the document code.<sup>8</sup>
- Whenever possible, receiving and/or transiting authorities should be informed about the travel plan of persons holding single-sheet ETDs, so as to ensure proper facilitation procedures (especially in case of transiting ports).
- States shall circulate specimen information to other States and concerned organizations such as airlines, including information on the design, security features and issuance procedures of single-sheet ETDs.
- States should define that no person should hold more than one valid ETD concurrently.
- A single-sheet ETD should be issued as near to the date of travel as possible to ensure it is used for the specified purpose and exact journey for which it was issued.

---

<sup>5</sup> Issuing Authorities may consider issuing a less secure document in conjunction with the receiving and/or transiting Authorities if the circumstances merit and justify this.

<sup>6</sup> Issuing States and organizations shall ensure machine readable booklet ETDs issued without the document code 'PE' expire before 1 January 2038. Refer to [Doc 9303-4](Doc_9303_Part4_Specs_for_MRPs_and_TD3_MRTDs.md) for further details regarding document codes.

### 4.2 Cost

The cost of issuing either type of ETD is a matter for the Issuing Authority, including any requirements on charging and fee waiving in its national legislation. The Issuing Authority should consider the level of charging at a rate that does not encourage the person to apply for an ETD rather than a standard full-validity passport. Also, the charge should be set at a level that discourages holders of standard full-validity passports from not taking sufficient care of their existing passport. The Issuing Authority may consider issuing an ETD free of charge, including in crisis situations (e.g. State of Emergency). Regardless of cost, in all cases the ETD should be issued only when all relevant checks have been completed.

#### 4.2.1 Principle

The charging structure within national frameworks for issuing ETDs should be clear, and applicants should be aware of the cost that will be applied.

#### 4.2.2 Recommended best practice

In the circumstances of a national or local crisis, the granting of an ETD may be free of charge.

### 4.3 Format

While there will always be the potential for situations to arise where it is impossible to produce the passport-sized machine readable booklet form of the ETD, this is to be regarded as the preferred standard primary document. Issuing Authorities should issue the most secure document that can be issued in the circumstances, while meeting all entitlement and security requirements. It is crucial that Issuing Authorities ensure the highest security level possible to deter fraudulent use.

#### 4.3.1 Principle

The document, if in booklet form, should be easily distinguishable from a standard full-validity passport but, as set out below, some format, security and design features should remain identical.

#### 4.3.2 Recommended best practice

Issuing Authorities should issue an ETD in a form that clearly distinguishes it from a standard full-validity passport. This may be a different-coloured cover and inner pages or the cover and pages might be the same but with an additional marking clearly indicating that they are different. It is recommended though that, for ease of recognition by border control authorities, a link be kept to the current standard passport.

- It is recommended that there be fewer pages than in a standard full-validity passport to reflect the fact that these are short-term documents, preferably with a maximum of eight (8) visa/inner pages.
- In accordance with Doc 9303, for the booklet form of the ETD, the photo, whether provided in paper or digital format, must be digitally printed in the ETD. Necessary measures shall be taken by the Issuing Authority or organization to ensure that the displayed photo is resistant to forgery and substitution.
- Stick-on photos are not permitted in accordance with Doc 9303<sup>9</sup> in the booklet form of the ETD due to the ease with which stick-on photos can be removed. Given that ETDs may not contain the same or as many security safeguards or features as a standard full-validity passport, steps need to be taken to protect the ETD wherever possible. Consequently, the integration and printing of the photo into the ETD booklet should be a standard requirement given the widespread recognition of the weakness of stick-on photos.
- The ETD should have a unique number printed pre-issuance which will enable an audit trail of which documents were issued to whom. This can be particularly important when documents are lost or stolen, either pre- or post-issuance.
- To the extent possible single-sheet ETDs should incorporate and assimilate the same principle and best practices, noting that, where stick-on photos need to be used, Issuing Authorities should consider using sticker/vignette laminates, or wet and/or dry stamps on the single-sheet ETDs as a mitigating practice and to increase security.

---

<sup>9</sup> In line with [Doc 9303-4](Doc_9303_Part4_Specs_for_MRPs_and_TD3_MRTDs.md): "The use of affixed or stick-on portrait photos is not permitted and these shall not be used. Instead, the portrait image shall be integrated with the biodata page using a secure personalization technology."

---

### 4.4 Validity

ETDs are issued for a variety of reasons, and it is no longer the case that they are used only for single journeys from one country back to the country of nationality, citizenship or residence. Many countries insist upon travellers having at least six (6) months' validity in their travel documents in order to issue visas or give leave to enter.

#### 4.4.1 Principle

Issuing Authorities should restrict validity to the minimum period required consistent with the purpose for which the document was issued and in line with the security of the document.

#### 4.4.2 Recommended best practice

- ETDs in booklet form should be issued with an absolute maximum validity of twelve (12) months (including any six-month entry and visa requirements).
- Single-sheet ETDs should be issued with a single journey restriction (which can include transit points).
- All ETDs should have final destinations and fixed named transit points on the document, and these should reflect the ticketed route.
- All ETDs should be replaced by a standard full-validity passport as soon as possible. (If time allows preferably during the validity of the ETD.)

### 4.5 Document title/name

In order to avoid confusion, the single term of "Emergency Travel Document (ETD)" should be used to describe this range of documents. This best reflects the idea of a distressed and unpredicted situation in an unequivocal manner. It thus mirrors the notions of urgent, critical, short-term and transitory.

The term is also broad enough to be seen in the context of two different existing ETDs: a booklet format and a single-sheet format. For the single-sheet ETD the words "single journey" should be inserted in the "validity" box.

#### 4.5.1 Principle

Issuing States or organizations should use a distinctive title or name on the ETDs so as to clearly identify the distressed and unpredicted situations in which such documents were issued (and to distinguish them from documents issued in situations where States choose to issue a regular passport or travel document book with limited validity, i.e., a temporary passport).

#### 4.5.2 Recommended best practice

- ETDs regardless of their format should be referred to as "Emergency Travel Documents" to clearly distinguish ETDs from standard full-validity passports and should include the word "Emergency" in the title.
- They can be issued in booklet or single-sheet format.
- In case of the single-sheet format, they should mention "single journey" in the "validity" box.

### 4.6 Post-issuance

The practices for resolving used ETDs with issuance systems vary widely, particularly depending on whether or not documents need to be retained by the traveller in order to collect a standard full-validity passport, and also depending on whether ETDs are issued by a different ministry or department from that issuing standard full-validity passports.

#### 4.6.1 Principle

Issuing States or organizations should take specific measures to prevent further use of post-use ETDs to minimize the chances of potential fraud.

#### 4.6.2 Recommended best practice

The document should be taken out of circulation at the border crossing point of the final destination, unless explicitly required or noted on the document by the Issuing Authorities.<sup>10</sup> The document should ultimately be returned to the Issuing Authorities for physical cancellation and/or mutilation to prevent it being used for further travel by impostors or fraudsters.

---

<sup>10</sup> For example, visa requirements (e.g. if an expired travel document contains a valid visa, the travel document, after invalidation, stays with its rightful holder).

They can be issued in booklet or single-sheet format.<br>xxvi. In case of the single-sheet format, they should mention "single journey" in the "validity" box. |
| **Post-issuance** | 6. Issuing States or organizations should take specific measures to prevent further use of post-use ETDs to minimize the chances of potential fraud. | xxvii. The document should be taken out of circulation at the border crossing point of the final destination, unless explicitly required or noted on the document by the Issuing Authorities. The document should ultimately be returned to the Issuing Authorities for physical cancellation and/or mutilation to prevent it from being used for further travel by impostors or fraudsters. |

## 6. USE OF OPTIONAL VISIBLE DIGITAL SEALS FOR ETDs

This section specifies the profile for digital seals in ETDs.

A Visible Digital Seal (VDS) is a 2D barcode that includes a cryptographically-signed data structure, which can be printed on a non-electronic document to increase its security. [Doc 9303-13](Doc_9303_Part13_Visible_Digital_Seals.md) specifies VDS for non-electronic documents.

Considering the ETD's limited security level compared to eMRTDs, they are being targeted by potential fraudsters. Digital seals are a means to ensure the integrity and authenticity of ETD data in situations where it is not possible to issue a standard full validity passport or other regular travel documents. A worked example for the MRZ of an ETD is described in Appendix B.

### 6.1 Content and Encoding Rules

#### 6.1.1 Header

The Document Feature Definition Reference for this use-case is 0x5E.

The Document Type Category for ETDs is 0x03.

Otherwise, the content of the header is the same as defined in [Doc 9303-13](Doc_9303_Part13_Visible_Digital_Seals.md).

#### 6.1.2 Document Features of a Digital Seal for ETDs

For the document feature set including only the MRZ as below, the Document Feature Definition Reference value is 94dec.

**Machine Readable Zone (REQUIRED)**

Basic information is encoded using a Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) of a TD2 size MROTD, see [Doc 9303-6](Doc_9303_Part6_Specs_for_TD2_MROTDs.md). The MRZ of ETDs contains the following information:

- document code<sup>11</sup>;
- issuing State or organization;
- primary and secondary identifiers of the document holder;
- document number;
- nationality of the document holder;
- date of birth of the document holder;
- sex of the document holder; and
- date of expiry.

**Additional Document Features (Future Use)**

In future versions of this specification additional (OPTIONAL and/or REQUIRED) feature fields may be defined. In case additional fields are present, a new unique Document Feature Definition Reference MUST be assigned for each combined set of OPTIONAL and REQUIRED feature fields.

---

<sup>11</sup> Effective 1 January 2026, single-sheet ETDs containing a machine readable zone shall reflect the designated PU document code. See section 4.1.5.

---

#### 6.1.3 Encoding Rules for Document Features

In the following, the digital encoding of document features of the ETD seal is defined.

**MRZ (TD2 Size, Doc 9303, Part 6: *Specifications for TD2 Size Machine Readable Official Travel Documents (MROTDs)*)**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Tag | 0x02 |
| Min. Length | 48 Byte |
| Max. Length | 48 Byte |
| Value Type | Alphanumeric |
| Required | Required |
| Content | The first and second lines of the MRZ of a TD2-MROTD (2×36 characters). The filler character (<) in the MRZ is replaced by <SPACE> prior to encoding by C40. |

#### 6.1.4 Signature

Appropriate key lengths offering protection against attacks SHALL be chosen for the hashing and signature algorithms. Suitable cryptographic catalogues SHOULD be taken into account.

### 6.2 Bar Code Signer and Seal Creation

A possible architecture and implementation for the ETD signer and its client is described in [Doc 9303-13](Doc_9303_Part13_Visible_Digital_Seals.md). For the security of the ETD signing system, see [Doc 9303-13](Doc_9303_Part13_Visible_Digital_Seals.md).

### 6.3 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Certificate Profiles

For the ETD, the requirements which are mentioned in [Doc 9303-12](Doc_9303_Part12_Public_Key_Infrastructure_for_MRTDs.md) apply. The following deviations are given for the specific ETD profile.

#### 6.3.1 Key Requirements (Validity Period)

**ETD Signer Certificates**

- Private Key Usage Time: 1 year + 2 months (the 2 months are meant for smooth roll-over)
- Certificate Validity: Private Key Usage Time + ETD Validity Timeframe

## APPENDIX A TO PART 8 — ETD VALIDATION POLICY RULES (INFORMATIVE)

The Validation Policy Rules outlined in [Doc 9303-13](Doc_9303_Part13_Visible_Digital_Seals.md) apply. In addition to these rules, there are further validation rules for the ETD which are described in the following paragraphs.

In addition to the generic document Validation Policy, the policy for ETDs considers the following questions:

1. Is the MRZ printed on the ETD valid?
2. Does the MRZ of the ETD match with the MRZ stored in the digital seal?

Further validation steps (e.g. utilizing additionally encoded data) are out of the scope of this profile. Outlined below are ETD-specific validation rules for each type of control, a list of the validation criteria, expected results for each criteria, and resulting status sub-indications.

**Visible Digital Seal Validation**

1. Format Validation
2. Digital Seal MRZ Validation:
   - if the checksums of the MRZ stored in the seal are not compliant/valid, then the status is INVALID with sub-indication INVALID_SEAL_MRZ.

If all checks above do not result in INVALID and the reader is not capable of processing the printed MRZ, the status is VALID. If the reader is capable of processing the printed MRZ, the next checks MUST be conducted:

3. Printed MRZ Validation (depending on reader capability):
   - if the checksums of the printed MRZ are not compliant/valid, then the status is INVALID with sub-indication INVALID_PRINTED_MRZ;
   - if the checksums of the printed MRZ are compliant/valid, then the printed MRZ should be compared character by character with the MRZ stored in the seal (note that for storing the MRZ in the seal, the filler character (<) is replaced by <SPACE>. If any characters mismatch, then the status is INVALID with sub-indication SEAL_DOCUMENT_MISMATCH; and
   - Otherwise, the result is VALID.

The above step covers a comparison of the data stored in the seal against data stored on the MRZ of the document. If an automatic check is impossible since the printed data of the document cannot be processed during validation, a manual inspection should be conducted by comparing the printed MRZ with the one stored in the (valid) seal.

**Table A-1. Trust Levels of the ETD Policy**

| Status indication | Sub-status indication | Trust level |
|---|---|---|
| INVALID | INVALID_SEAL_MRZ | High fraud potential |
| | INVALID_PRINTED_MRZ | |
| | SEAL_DOCUMENT_MISMATCH | |

*Note.— Both MRZ lines above measure 36 characters (TD2 format), not the
44-character TD3 width — this Emergency Travel Document example uses the
TD2-size MRZ. The lines were recovered from the source PDF by extracting
each word's on-page coordinates and concatenating left to right, rather than
trusting flat text order: the PDF's flat text layer interleaves the two
`<`-filler runs with the name and yields spurious literal spaces (a
two-column-ish layout that plain text extraction does not linearize
correctly), which is what the previous transcription reproduced verbatim.*

The seal's byte payload, reconstructed the same way (word coordinates
clustered into the source table's true 16-column × 9-row grid, rather than
the 9-column layout previously guessed from flat text order):

| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 | Col 4 | Col 5 | Col 6 | Col 7 | Col 8 | Col 9 | Col 10 | Col 11 | Col 12 | Col 13 | Col 14 | Col 15 | Col 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DC | 03 | D9 | C5 | D9 | CA | C8 | A7 | 3A | 99 | 5D | 91 | 3A | 7D | 9C | 57 |
| 5E | 03 | 02 | 30 | BA | B3 | D2 | B3 | C5 | 49 | CD | 1D | A9 | 3C | 5B | D4 |
| 58 | 13 | 5C | 6F | 57 | FC | 13 | 3C | 13 | 3C | 13 | 3C | 6B | 38 | 20 | 8A |
| 4D | 0D | 4A | 32 | B0 | C1 | 1A | E6 | 26 | 84 | 27 | 15 | 3F | 7C | 45 | 3C |
| 13 | 3C | 13 | 45 | FF | 40 | 39 | 03 | 4E | 85 | DA | 18 | 3C | 1C | C0 | D3 |
| AC | 16 | 73 | 2D | 7E | E2 | C2 | 0D | 7A | EF | 7B | 38 | 1C | 0A | E5 | 09 |
| F1 | 0A | 97 | 89 | 0D | 51 | 1C | 3C | 47 | B9 | 48 | 07 | A4 | D0 | F6 | 7C |
| E9 | 08 | 3A | 7F | 20 | 6F | 04 | FB | 35 | AF | DB | 8A | B9 | 65 | 8A | 93 |
| 32 | 7A | 4E | 0E | E6 | ED | | | | | | | | | | |

Read column by column, top to bottom (Col 1 then Col 2, and so on) — 134
values total, matching "Datamatrix contains 134 bytes of data" exactly.
Corrected from the previous 9-column table, which had reordered 15 of the
source's 16 columns from flat text-extraction order (with two columns
transposed) and dropped one entire column (Col 14 above: `7D 3C 38 7C 1C 0A
D0 65`) rather than an evenly-spread ~13 missing bytes as the old inline
comment estimated.
