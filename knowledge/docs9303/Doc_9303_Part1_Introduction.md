## 1. FOREWORD

ICAO’s work on machine readable travel documents began in 1968 with the establishment, by the Air Transport Committee of the Council, of a Panel on Passport Cards. This Panel was charged with developing recommendations for a standardized passport book or card that would be machine readable, in the interest of accelerating the clearance of passengers through passport controls. The Panel produced a number of recommendations, including the adoption of optical character recognition (OCR) as the machine reading technology of choice due to its maturity, cost-effectiveness and reliability. In 1980, the specifications and guidance material developed by the Panel were published as the first edition of Doc 9303, titled *A Passport with Machine Readable Capability*, which became the basis for the initial issuance of machine readable passports by Australia, Canada and the United States.

In 1984, ICAO established what is now known as the Technical Advisory Group on Machine Readable Travel Documents (TAG/MRTD), comprised of government officials who specialize in the issuance and border inspection of passports and other travel documents, in order to update and enhance the specifications which had been prepared by the Panel. Subsequently, this group’s terms of reference were expanded to include, first, the development of specifications for a machine readable visa and, later, specifications for machine readable cards that may be used as official travel documents.

In 1998, the New Technologies Working Group of the TAG/MRTD began work to establish the most effective biometric identification system and associated means of data storage for use in MRTD applications, particularly in relation to document issuance and immigration considerations. The bulk of the work had been completed by the time the events of 11 September 2001 caused States to attach greater importance to the security of a travel document and the identification of its holder. The work was quickly finalized and endorsed by the TAG/MRTD and the Air Transport Committee.

The resulting Technical Reports on the employment of biometrics and contactless chip technology, Logical Data Structure (LDS), and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) were incorporated into Volume 2 of the Sixth Edition of Doc 9303, Part 1 (Machine Readable Passports) in 2006, and Volume 2 of the Third Edition of Doc 9303, Part 3 (Machine Readable Official Travel Documents) in 2008.

## 2. SCOPE

Doc 9303 consists of various separate documents in which general (applicable to all MRTDs) as well as MRTD form factor specific specifications are grouped. See Section 5.1 “Doc 9303 Composition” for an overview.

These specifications are not intended to be a standard for national identity documents. However, a State whose identity documents are recognized by other States as valid travel documents shall design its identity documents such that they conform to the specifications of [Doc 9303-3](Doc_9303_Part3_Specs_Common_to_all_MRTDs.md) and [Doc 9303-4](Doc_9303_Part4_Specs_for_MRPs_and_TD3_MRTDs.md), [Doc 9303-5](Doc_9303_Part5_Specs_for_TD1_MROTDs.md) or [Doc 9303-6](Doc_9303_Part6_Specs_for_TD2_MROTDs.md).

Although the specifications in [Doc 9303-4](Doc_9303_Part4_Specs_for_MRPs_and_TD3_MRTDs.md) are intended for particular application to the passport, these specifications apply equally to other TD3 size identity documents, for example, the laissez-passer, the seafarer’s identity document and refugee travel documents.

The document at hand is Part 1. Part 1 introduces the Doc 9303 specifications. It describes the build-up of the thirteen parts of Doc 9303, provides general information on ICAO, and guidance on the terminology and abbreviations used throughout the specifications.

## 3. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 3.1 ICAO’s Leadership Role

ICAO’s initiative to develop standard specifications for passports and other travel documents followed the tradition established by the League of Nations Passport Conferences of the 1920s and the work of the League’s successor, the United Nations Organization. ICAO’s mandate to continue in its leadership role stems from the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the “Chicago Convention”) which covers the full range of requirements for efficient and orderly civil aviation operations, including provisions for clearance of persons through border controls, i.e.:

a) the requirement for persons travelling by air and aircraft crews to comply with immigration, customs and passport regulations (Article 13);
b) the requirement for States to facilitate border clearance formalities and prevent unnecessary delays (Article 22);
c) the requirement that States collaborate in these matters (Article 23); and
d) the requirement for States to develop and adopt internationally standard procedures for immigration and customs clearance (Article 37 j)).

Under this mandate, ICAO develops and maintains international Standards in Annex 9 — Facilitation to the Chicago Convention for implementation by Member States. In the development of such Standards, it is a fundamental precept that if public authorities are to facilitate inspection formalities for the vast majority of air travellers, those authorities must have a satisfactory level of confidence in the reliability of travel documents and in the effectiveness of inspection procedures. The production of standardized specifications for travel documents and the data contained therein is aimed at building that confidence.

In 2004, the Assembly of ICAO affirmed that cooperative work on specifications to strengthen the security and integrity of travel documents should be pursued by the Organization as a matter of high priority. In addition to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), consultants to the TAG/MRTD include the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Airports Council International (ACI), and the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL).

In 2005, the then 188 Member States of ICAO approved a new Standard that all States must begin issuing machine readable passports in accordance with Doc 9303 no later than the year 2010. No later than the year 2015 all non-machine readable travel documents must have expired. This Standard is published in the 13th Edition (2011) of Annex 9 — Facilitation.

### 3.2 Relative Costs and Benefits of Machine Readable Travel Documents

Experience with the issuance of machine readable passports, in conformity with the specifications set forth in Doc 9303, indicates that the cost of producing MRTDs may be no greater than that of producing conventional documents, though the cost will be higher when biometric identification and electronic travel documents are implemented. As traffic volumes grow and more States focus on how they can rationalize their clearance processes with the employment of computerized databases and electronic data interchange, the MRTD plays a pivotal part in modern, enhanced compliance systems. Equipment to read the documents and access the databases may entail a substantial investment, but this can be expected to be returned by the improvements in security, clearance speed and accuracy of verification which such systems provide. Use of MRTDs in automated clearance systems may also make it possible for States to eliminate both the requirement for paper documents, such as passenger manifests and embarkation/disembarkation cards, and the administrative costs associated with the related manual procedures.

### 3.3 Operations

The basic machine readable travel document, with its OCR readability, is designed for both visual and mechanical reading.

ICAO Member States have recognized that standardization is a necessity and that the benefits of adopting the Doc 9303 standard formats for passports and other travel documents extend beyond the obvious advantages for States that have the machine readers and databases for use in automated clearance systems. In fact, the physical characteristics and data security features of the documents themselves offer strong defence against alteration, forgery or counterfeit.

Moreover, adoption of the standardized format for the visual zone of an MRTD facilitates inspection by airline and government officials, with the result that clearance of low-risk traffic is expedited, problem cases are more readily identified, and enforcement is improved. The optional introduction of biometric identification with data stored on a contactless integrated circuit will provide greater security and resistance to fraud and thus make it easier for the legitimate document holder to obtain visas for travel and to be processed through border inspection systems.

> **Note:** It is recognized that situations will arise where an eMRTD will not interface correctly with a reader at a border. There are several reasons why this might occur, of which a failure of the eMRTD is only one. ICAO emphasizes that an eMRTD which fails to read is nevertheless a valid document. However, a failure to read could be the result of fraudulent attack, and the receiving State should establish its own procedures for dealing with this possibility, which should involve more stringent inspection of the document and its holder but also allow that the failure involves no fraudulent intent.

### 3.4 Endorsement by ISO

The technical specifications sections of Doc 9303 have received the endorsement of the International Organization for Standardization as ISO Standard 7501. Such endorsement is made possible by means of a liaison mechanism through which manufacturers of travel documents, readers and other technologies provide technical and engineering advice to the TAG/TRIP under the auspices of ISO. Through this working relationship, the ICAO specifications have achieved, and are expected to continue to receive, the status of worldwide standards by means of a simplified procedure within ISO.

The liaison mechanism with ISO has been successfully applied not only to the endorsement of new specifications for travel documents as ISO standards but also to the approval of amendments to the specifications. Subsequent revisions to Doc 9303 will therefore be processed for ISO endorsement in the same manner as previously.

### 4.3 Key Words

Key words are used to signify requirements. The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” used in capitalized form in Doc 9303 are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]:

- **MUST**: This word, or the terms “REQUIRED” or “SHALL”, means that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
- **MUST NOT**: This phrase, or the phrase “SHALL NOT”, means that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
- **SHOULD**: This word, or the adjective “RECOMMENDED”, means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
- **SHOULD NOT**: This phrase, or the phrase “NOT RECOMMENDED” means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behaviour is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behaviour described with this label.
- **MAY**: This word, or the adjective “OPTIONAL”, means that an item is truly optional. One user may choose to include the item because a particular application requires it or because the user feels that it enhances the application while another user may omit the same item. An implementation that does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation that does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides).
- **CONDITIONAL**: The usage of an item is dependent on the usage of other items. It is therefore further qualified under which conditions the item is REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED. This is an additional key word used in Doc 9303 (not part of RFC 2119).

> **Guidance in the use:** Imperatives of the type defined here must be used with care and sparingly. In particular, they MUST be used only where it is actually required for interoperation or to limit behaviour that has potential for causing harm (e.g. limiting retransmissions). For example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method on implementers where the method is not required for interoperability.
> 
> **Security considerations:** These terms are frequently used to specify behaviour with security implications. The effects on security of not implementing a MUST or SHOULD, or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD NOT be done, may be very subtle. Document authors should take the time to elaborate the security implications of not following recommendations or requirements, as most implementers will not have had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the specification.

In case OPTIONAL features are implemented, they MUST be implemented as described in Doc 9303.

In Doc 9303, the appendices are informative. If one claims compliancy to an (informative) appendix, the key words used in that appendix MUST be respected as specified.

### 4.5 The Use of Notes

While in ISO/IEC standards notes are informative, in Doc 9303 notes are part of the normative text and used to emphasize requirements or additional information.

## 5. GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF DOC 9303

### 5.1 Doc 9303 Composition

Doc 9303 is comprised of thirteen parts. Each part describes a specific aspect of the MRTD. The parts of Doc 9303 are composed in such way that the issuer of MRTDs can compose a complete set of relevant specifications, relevant to a specific type of MRTD (form factor). The relationship between these form factors and the parts of Doc 9303 is described in Section 5.2 of this Part 1.

The following parts form the complete Doc 9303 specifications for Machine Readable Travel Documents:

- **Part 1 — Introduction**
  The document at hand is Part 1.
- **Part 2 — Specifications for the Security of the Design, Manufacture and Issuance of MRTDs**
  Part 2 provides mandatory and optional specifications for the precautions to be taken by travel document issuing authorities to ensure that their MRTDs, and their means of personalization and issuance to the rightful holders, are secure against fraudulent attack. Mandatory and optional specifications are also provided for the physical security to be provided at the premises where the MRTDs are produced, personalized and issued and for the vetting of personnel involved in these operations.
- **Part 3 — Specifications common to all MRTDs**
  Part 3 defines specifications that are common to TD1, TD2 and TD3 size Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs) including those necessary for global interoperability using visual inspection and machine readable (optical character recognition) means. Detailed specifications applicable to each document type appear in Doc 9303, Parts 4 through 7.
- **Part 4 — Specifications for Machine Readable Passports (MRPs) and other TD3 size MRTDs**
  Part 4 defines specifications that are specific to TD3 size Machine Readable Passports (MRPs) and other TD3 size Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs). For brevity, the term MRP has been used throughout Part 4 and, except where stated, all the specifications herein shall apply equally to all other TD3 size MRTDs.
- **Part 5 — Specifications for TD1 size Machine Readable Official Travel Documents (MROTDs)**
  Part 5 defines specifications that are specific to TD1 size Machine Readable Official Travel Documents (MROTDs).
- **Part 6 — Specifications for TD2 size Machine Readable Official Travel Documents (MROTDs)**
  Part 6 defines specifications that are specific to TD2 size Machine Readable Official Travel Documents (MROTDs).
- **Part 7 — Machine Readable Visas**
  Part 7 defines the specifications for Machine Readable Visas (MRVs) which allow compatibility and global interchange using both visual (eye readable) and machine readable means. The specifications for visas can, where issued by a State and accepted by a receiving State, be used for travel purposes. The MRV shall, as a minimum, contain the data specified in a form that is legible both visually and by optical character recognition methods, as presented in Part 7. Part 7 contains specifications for both Format-A as well as Format-B types of visas, and is based on the Third Edition of Doc 9303, Part 2, Machine Readable Visas (2005).
- **Part 8 — Emergency Travel Documents**
  Part 8 provides guidance and specifications on Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs). The purpose of this guidance material is to promote a consistent approach in the issuance of ETDs in order to enhance the security of the document, protect the individual, promote greater confidence for border staff in handling ETDs at ports, and address the vulnerabilities presented by inconsistent practices and security features. Part 8 also specifies the use of Visible Digital Seals in ETDs.
- **Part 9 — Deployment of Biometric Identification and Electronic Storage of Data in MRTDs**
  Part 9 defines the specifications, additional to those for the basic MRTD set forth in Parts 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of Doc 9303, to be used by States wishing to issue an electronic Machine Readable Travel Document (eMRTD) capable of being used by any suitably equipped receiving State to read from the document a greatly increased amount of data relating to the eMRTD itself and its holder. This includes mandatory globally interoperable biometric data that can be used as an input to facial recognition systems, and, optionally, to fingerprint or iris recognition systems. The specifications require the globally interoperable biometric data to be stored in the form of high-resolution images.
- **Part 10 — Logical Data Structure (LDS) for Storage of Biometrics and Other Data in the Contactless Integrated Circuit (IC)**  
  Part 10 defines a Logical Data Structure (LDS) for eMRTDs required for global interoperability. The contactless integrated circuit capacity expansion technology contained in an eMRTD selected by an issuing State or organization SHALL allow data to be accessible by receiving States. Part 10 defines the specifications for the standardized organization of these data. This requires the identification of all mandatory and optional Data Elements and a prescriptive ordering and/or grouping of Data Elements that SHALL be followed to achieve global interoperability for reading of details (Data Elements) recorded in the capacity expansion technology optionally included on an MRTD (eMRTD).
- **Part 11 — Security Mechanisms for MRTDs**
  Part 11 provides specifications to enable States and suppliers to implement cryptographic security features for Machine Readable Travel Documents (eMRTDs) offering ICC read-only access. Part 11 specifies cryptographic protocols to:
  - prevent skimming of data from the contactless IC;
  - prevent eavesdropping on the communication between the IC and reader;
  - provide authentication of the data stored on the IC based on the PKI described in Part 12, and provide authentication of the IC itself.
- **Part 12 — Public Key Infrastructure for MRTDs**
  Part 12 defines the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the eMRTD application. Requirements for issuing States or organizations are specified, including operation of a Certification Authority (CA) that issues certificates and CRLs. Requirements for receiving States and their Inspection Systems validating those certificates and CRLs are also specified.
- **Part 13 — Visible Digital Seals for non-electronic documents**
  Part 13 specifies a digital seal to ensure the authenticity and integrity of non-electronic documents in a comparatively inexpensive, but highly secure manner using asymmetric cryptography. The information on the non-electronic document is cryptographically signed, and the signature is encoded as a two-dimensional bar code and printed on the document itself.
