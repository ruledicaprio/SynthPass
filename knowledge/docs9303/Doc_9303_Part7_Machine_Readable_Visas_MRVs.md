## 1. SCOPE

Part 7 defines the specifications for machine readable visas (MRV) which allow compatibility and global interchange using both visual (eye readable) and machine readable means. The specifications lay down standards for visas which can, where issued by a State and accepted by a receiving State, be used for travel purposes. The MRV shall, as a minimum, contain the data specified herein in a form that is legible both visually and by optical character recognition methods, as presented herein. Part 7 contains specifications for both Format-A and Format-B types of visas.

Part 7 shall be read in conjunction with:

- Part 1 — *Introduction*;
- Part 2 — *Specifications for the Security of the Design, Manufacture and Issuance of MRTDs*;
- Part 3 — *Specifications Common to all MRTDs*; and
- Part 13 — *Visible Digital Seals*.

---

## 2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR FORMAT-A MACHINE READABLE VISAS (MRV-A)

This section defines those specifications which are unique to Format-A machine readable visas (MRV-A) and are necessary for global interoperability. Specifications are included for the discretionary expansion of the machine readable data capacity of the MRV beyond that defined for global interoperability. The MRV-A is suitable for use by States that wish to have maximum space available to accommodate their data requirements and that do not need to maintain a clear area on the passport visa page adjacent to the visa.

### 2.1 Dimensions and Placement of the MRV-A

The dimensions and placement of the MRV-A shall be as follows:

**MRV-A nominal dimensions.** The nominal dimensions of the MRV-A shall be as follows:

80.0 mm × 120.0 mm (3.15 in × 4.72 in)

**MRV-A margins.** The dimensional specifications refer to the outer limits of the MRV-A. A margin of 2.0 mm (0.08 in) along each outer edge, with the exception of the header zone, must be left clear of data.

**MRV-A edge tolerances.** The edges of the MRV-A shall be within the area circumscribed by the concentric rectangles as illustrated in Figure 1.

- **Inner rectangle:** 79.0 mm × 119.0 mm (3.11 in × 4.69 in)
- **Outer rectangle:** 81.0 mm × 121.0 mm (3.19 in × 4.76 in)

**MRV-A thickness.** If the visa is issued as a label, the increase in thickness once the label is attached to the passport visa page shall not exceed 0.19 mm (0.0075 in). The thickness of the area within the machine readable zone (MRZ) shall not vary by more than 0.05 mm (0.002 in). If a protective laminate is used, it is recommended that its thickness not exceed 0.15 mm (0.006 in).

**General note.** — The decimal notation used in these specifications conforms to ICAO practice. This differs from ISO practice where a decimal point (.) in imperial measurements and a comma (,) in metric measurements are used.

**Placement of the MRV-A.** The MRV-A shall be positioned as follows:

The MRV-A shall be located on the passport visa page such that the MRZ is coincident with and parallel to the outside edge (reference edge) of the passport visa page, and the left edge of the MRV-A is coincident with and parallel to the left edge of the passport visa page as defined in Appendix C, Section C.1.

The MRZ shall be located such that the two OCR lines contained therein are within the Effective Reading Zone (ERZ) as defined in Doc 9303-3.

Only one MRV-A shall be located on a passport visa page (see Appendix C, Section C.1).

## 3. GENERAL LAYOUT OF THE MRV-A

The MRV-A follows a standardized layout to facilitate reading of data globally, by visual and machine readable means, to accommodate the various requirements of States' laws and practices and to achieve the maximum standardization within those divergent requirements.

The standard layout incorporates space for a portrait of the holder and other identification feature(s). The inclusion of a portrait on a visa is strongly recommended in the interests of security, but States who are not yet able to apply portraits may fill this space with, for example, a national crest.

### 3.1 MRV-A Zones

An MRV-A is divided into six zones as follows:

| Zone | Type | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Zone I | Mandatory | Header |
| Zone II | Mandatory and optional | Personal data elements |
| Zone III | Mandatory and optional | Document data elements |
| Zone IV | Optional | Signature (original or reproduction) or authentication |
| Zone V | Mandatory zone | Identification feature (feature optional) |
| Zone VII | Mandatory | Machine readable zone (MRZ) |

> **Note 1.** — The signature in Zone IV of a visa is that of an issuing officer, not of the document holder. The signature may be replaced or accompanied by an official stamp.
>
> **Note 2.** — To facilitate inspection of visas at border control, the layout of the visa presents Zone III above Zone II.
>
> **Note 3.** — Zone VI is not available on an MRV issued in the form of a label.
>
> **Note 4.** — Zones I to V constitute the Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ).

Zones I and VII are mandatory. Certain data in Zones II and III are also mandatory. The mandatory components of these four Zones represent the minimum data requirements for an MRV-A. The optional data elements in Zones II, III and V and in optional Zone IV may be utilized to accommodate the diverse requirements of States, while achieving the desired level of standardization. The data elements which may be included in the various zones and their order are set out in Section 4.4. Section 4.4 also illustrates the dimensional specifications and tolerances for the layout of the MRV-A and the technical specifications for the printing of data elements within the zones, as well as the guidelines for positioning and adjusting the dimensional specifications of Zones I to V to accommodate the flexibility desired by issuing States. Examples of personalized MRV-As are shown in Appendix A, Section A.1. Appendix B, Section B.1 illustrates the format for the presentation of the machine readable data in Zone VII.

### 3.2 Content, Use and Dimensional Flexibility of Zones

The data elements to be included in the zones, the treatment of the zones and guidelines for the dimensional layout of zones shall be as described hereunder.

Zone I identifies the issuing State and the type of document. These elements are mandatory. The order of the data elements in this zone is left to the discretion of the issuing State.

To facilitate the checking of visas by airline personnel and control authorities, the essential details of the visa document shall be entered in a standard sequence in Zone III while essential personal details of the holder shall be entered in a standard sequence in Zone II. On a visa, Zone III appears above Zone II.

Zone IV provides space for an optional signature or authentication. This is normally the signature of the issuing officer or an official stamp. The application of an official stamp elsewhere on the document is not precluded except that it must not intrude into the MRZ or affect the legibility of entered data.

Zone VII conforms in height to the MRZ defined for all MRTDs so that the machine readable data lines fall within the ERZ specified in Doc 9303-3, thus allowing a single reader to be used for all types and sizes of MRTDs.

All MRZ data elements are mandatory and shall be shown as defined in Section 4.2 even though an issuing State may choose not to include a specific MRZ data element in the VIZ.

### 3.3 Dimensional Flexibility of Zones I to V

Zones I to V may be adjusted in size and shape within the overall dimensional specifications of the MRV-A to accommodate the diverse requirements of issuing States. All zones, however, shall be bounded by straight lines, and all angles where straight lines join shall be right angles (i.e. 90 degrees). It is recommended that the zone boundaries not be printed on the MRV-A. The nominal position of the zones is shown in Section 4.4, Figure 4.

When an issuing State chooses to produce an MRV-A as a securely attached card containing a transparent or otherwise unprintable border around the card, the available area within the zones will be reduced. The full MRV-A dimensions and zone boundaries shall be measured from the outside edge of this border, which is the external edge of the MRV-A.

Zone I shall be adjacent and parallel to the top edge of the MRV-A and extend across the full 120.0 mm ± 1.0 mm (4.72 in ± 0.04 in) dimension. The issuing State may vary the *vertical* dimension of Zone I, as required, but this dimension shall be sufficient to allow legibility of the data elements in the zone, and the height shall not be greater than 12.0 mm (0.47 in) as defined in Section 4.4, Figure 4.

Zone V shall be located such that its left edge is coincident with the left edge of the MRV-A, as defined in Section 4.4, Figure 4. Zone V may vary in size but any variation from the nominal dimensions shall not exceed the tolerances specified in Section 4.4, Figure 4.

Zone V may move *vertically* along the left edge of the MRV-A and overlay a portion of Zone I as long as individual details contained in either zone are not obscured. Zone V may, as a result, have its *lower external boundary* coincident with the top edge of the MRZ of the MRV-A and its *upper external boundary* coincident with the top edge of the MRV-A.

The upper boundary of Zone III shall be coincident with the lower boundary of Zone I.

Zone III may extend to the full width of that portion of the MRV-A to the right of Zone V.

The lower boundary of Zone III (see Section 4.4, Figure 4) may be positioned at the discretion of the issuing State. Enough space shall be left for Zone II and Zone IV (when used) below the boundary.

Normally, the upper boundary of Zone II should be coincident with the lower boundary of Zone III. The boundary does not have to be straight across the 120.0 mm ± 1.0 mm (4.72 in ± 0.04 in) dimension of the visa. Zone II may also overlay a portion of Zone V for the MRV-A, if required. When this occurs, issuing States shall ensure that data contained in either zone are not obscured. See Appendix A, Section A.1, Figure A-2.

Zone IV, when included on the MRV-A, shall be entered on the right-hand side of the visa immediately above but not intruding into the MRZ. See Section 4.4, Figure 5.

## 4. DETAILED LAYOUT OF THE MRV-A

### 4.1 Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ) (Zones I-V)

All data in the VIZ shall be clearly legible.

**Print spacing.** The design of the MRV-A in Zones II and III is based on a vertical line spacing of a maximum of 8 lines per 25.4 mm (1.0 in) and a horizontal printing density of a maximum of 15 characters per 25.4 mm (1.0 in). This spacing has been chosen as the smallest in which information is clear and legible. If any optional field or data element is not used, the entered data may be spread out in the VIZ of the MRV-A consistent with the requirement for sequencing zones and data elements. This horizontal printing density and the font and the vertical line spacing may be adjusted at the discretion of each State, provided that in the VIZ all data shall be printed in a size such that they can be easily read and assimilated by a person with normal eyesight. Typical configurations are shown in Appendix A. Zone VII, the mandatory MRZ, shall be printed with a line spacing as defined in Section 4.4, Figure 3, and a horizontal printing density of 10 characters per 25.4 mm (1.0 in).

## 5. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR FORMAT-B MACHINE READABLE VISAS (MRV-B)

This section defines the specifications which are unique to Format-B machine readable visas (MRV-B) and are necessary for global interoperability. Specifications are included for the discretionary expansion of the machine readable data capacity of the MRV beyond that defined for global interchange. The MRV-B is suitable for use by States who wish to maintain a clear area on the passport visa page adjacent to the visa, so as to allow a seal to be placed on the visa and the passport page on which it is affixed.

### 5.1 Dimensions and Placement of the MRV-B

The dimensions and placement of the MRV-B shall be as follows:

**MRV-B nominal dimensions.** The nominal dimensions of the MRV-B are based on ISO/IEC 7810, ID-2 Type Card as follows:

74.0 mm × 105.0 mm (2.91 in × 4.13 in)

**MRV-B margins.** The dimensional specifications refer to the outer limits of the MRV-B. A margin of 2.0 mm (0.08 in) along each outer edge, with the exception of the header zone, must be left clear of data.

**MRV-B edge tolerances.** The edges of the MRV-B shall be within the area circumscribed by the concentric rectangles as illustrated in Figure 6.

- **Inner rectangle:** 73.0 mm × 104.0 mm (2.87 in × 4.09 in)
- **Outer rectangle:** 75.0 mm × 106.0 mm (2.95 in × 4.17 in)

> **Figure 6. MRV-B dimensional illustration**
>
> *Not to scale*
>
> [Diagram showing outer rectangle, inner rectangle, and outer edge of MRV-B]

**MRV-B thickness.** If the visa is issued as a label, the increase in thickness once the label is attached to the passport visa page shall not exceed 0.19 mm (0.0075 in). The thickness of the area within the machine readable zone (MRZ) shall not vary by more than 0.05 mm (0.002 in). If a protective laminate is used, it is recommended that its thickness not exceed 0.15 mm (0.006 in).

**General note.** — The decimal notation used in these specifications conforms to ICAO practice. This differs from ISO practice where a decimal point (.) in imperial measurements and a comma (,) in metric measurements is used.

**Placement of the MRV-B.** The MRV-B shall be positioned as follows:

The MRV-B shall be located on the passport visa page such that the MRZ is coincident with and parallel to the outside edge (reference edge) of the passport visa page, and the left edge of the MRV-B is coincident with and parallel to the left edge of the passport visa page as defined in Appendix C, Section C.2.

The MRZ shall be located such that the two OCR lines contained therein are within the Effective Reading Zone (ERZ) as defined in Doc 9303-3.

Only one MRV-B shall be located on a passport visa page (see Appendix C, Section C.2).

---

## 6. GENERAL LAYOUT OF THE MRV-B

The MRV-B follows a standardized layout to facilitate reading of data globally, by visual and machine readable means, to accommodate the various requirements of States' laws and practices and to achieve the maximum standardization within those divergent requirements.

The standard layout incorporates space for a portrait of the holder and other identification feature(s). The inclusion of a portrait on a visa is strongly recommended in the interests of security, but States that are not yet able to apply portraits may fill this space with, for example, a national crest.

### 6.1 MRV-B Zones

An MRV-B is divided into six zones as follows:

| Zone | Type | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Zone I | Mandatory | Header |
| Zone II | Mandatory and optional | Personal data elements |
| Zone III | Mandatory and optional | Document data elements |
| Zone IV | Optional | Signature (original or reproduction) or authentication |
| Zone V | Mandatory zone | Identification feature (feature optional) |
| Zone VII | Mandatory | Machine readable zone (MRZ) |

> **Note 1.** — The signature in Zone IV of a visa is that of an issuing officer, not of the document holder. The signature may be replaced or accompanied by an official stamp.
>
> **Note 2.** — To facilitate inspection of visas at border control, the layout of the visa presents Zone III above Zone II.
>
> **Note 3.** — Zone VI is not available on an MRV issued in the form of a label.
>
> **Note 4.** — Zones I to V constitute the Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ).

Zones I and VII are mandatory. Certain data in Zones II and III are also mandatory. The mandatory components of these four Zones represent the minimum data requirements for an MRV-B. The optional data elements in Zones II, III and V and in optional Zone IV may be utilized to accommodate the diverse requirements of States, while achieving the desired level of standardization. The data elements which may be included in the various zones and their order are set out in Section 7.4. Section 7.4 also illustrates the dimensional specifications and tolerances for the two layouts of the MRV-B and the technical specifications for the printing of data elements within the zones, as well as the guidelines for positioning and adjusting the dimensional specifications of Zones I to V to accommodate the flexibility desired by issuing States. Examples of personalized MRV-Bs are shown in Appendix A, Section A.2. Appendix B, Section B.2 illustrates the format for the presentation of the machine readable data in Zone VII.

### 6.2 Content, Use and Dimensional Flexibility of Zones

The data elements to be included in the zones, the treatment of the zones and guidelines for the dimensional layout of zones shall be as described hereunder.

Zone I identifies the issuing State and the type of document. These elements are mandatory. The order of the data elements in this zone is left to the discretion of the issuing State.

To facilitate the checking of visas by airline personnel and control authorities, the essential details of the visa document shall be entered in a standard sequence in Zone III while essential personal details of the holder shall be entered in a standard sequence in Zone II. On a visa, Zone III appears above Zone II.

Zone IV provides space for an optional signature or authentication. This is normally the signature of the issuing officer or an official stamp. The application of an official stamp elsewhere on the document is not precluded except that it must not intrude into the MRZ or affect the legibility of entered data.

Zone VII conforms in height to the MRZ defined for all MRTDs so that the machine readable data lines fall within the ERZ specified in Doc 9303-3, thus allowing a single reader to be used for all types and sizes of MRTDs.

All MRZ data elements are mandatory and shall be shown as defined in Section 7.2 even though an issuing State may choose not to include a specific MRZ data element in the VIZ.

### 6.3 Dimensional Flexibility of Zones I to V

Zones I to V may be adjusted in size and shape within the overall dimensional specifications of the MRV-B to accommodate the diverse requirements of issuing States. All zones, however, shall be bounded by straight lines, and all angles where straight lines join shall be right angles (i.e. 90 degrees). It is recommended that the zone boundaries not be printed on the MRV-B. The nominal position of the zones is shown in Section 7.4, Figure 9.

When an issuing State chooses to produce an MRV-B as a securely attached card containing a transparent or otherwise unprintable border around the card, the available area within the zones will be reduced. The full MRV-B dimensions and zone boundaries shall be measured from the outside edge of this border, which is the external edge of the MRV-B.

Zone I shall be adjacent and parallel to the top edge of the MRV-B and extend across the full 105.0 mm ± 1.0 mm (4.13 in ± 0.04 in) dimension. The issuing State may vary the *vertical* dimension of Zone I, as required, but the dimension shall be sufficient to allow legibility of the data elements, and the height shall not be greater than 12.0 mm (0.47 in) as defined in Section 7.4, Figure 9.

Zone V shall be located such that its left edge is coincident with the left edge of the MRV-B, as defined in Section 7.4, Figure 9. Zone V may vary in size but any variation from the nominal dimensions shall not exceed the tolerances specified in Section 7.4, Figure 9.

Zone V may move *vertically* along the left edge of the MRV-B and overlay a portion of Zone I as long as individual details contained in either zone are not obscured. Zone V may, as a result, have its *lower external boundary* coincident with the top edge of the MRZ of the MRV-B and its *upper external boundary* coincident with the top edge of the MRV-B.

The upper boundary of Zone III shall be coincident with the lower boundary of Zone I.

Zone III may extend to the full width of that portion of the MRV-B to the right of Zone V.

The lower boundary of Zone III (see Section 7.4, Figure 9) may be positioned at the discretion of the issuing State. Enough space shall be left for Zone II and Zone IV (when used) below the boundary. The boundary does not need to be straight across the 105.0 mm ± 1.0 mm (4.13 in ± 0.04 in) dimension of the MRV-B.

Normally, the upper boundary of Zone II should be coincident with the lower boundary of Zone III. The boundary does not have to be straight across the 105.0 mm ± 1.0 mm (4.13 in ± 0.04 in) dimension of the visa. Zone II may also overlay a portion of Zone V for the MRV-B if required. When this occurs, issuing States shall ensure that data contained in either zone are not obscured. See Appendix A, A.2.

Zone IV, when included on the MRV-B, shall be entered on the right hand side of the visa immediately above but not intruding into the MRZ. See Section 7.4, Figure 9.

---

## 7. DETAILED LAYOUT OF THE MRV-B

### 7.1 Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ) (Zones I-V)

All data in the VIZ shall be clearly legible.

**Print spacing.** The design of the MRV-B in Zones II and III is based on a vertical line spacing of a maximum of 8 lines per 25.4 mm (1.0 in) and a horizontal printing density of a maximum of 15 characters per 25.4 mm (1.0 in). This spacing has been chosen as the smallest in which information is clear and legible. If any optional field or data element is not used, the entered data may be spread out in the VIZ of the MRV-B consistent with the requirement for sequencing zones and data elements. This horizontal printing density and the font and the vertical line spacing may be adjusted at the discretion of each State, provided that in the VIZ all data shall be printed in a size such that they can be easily read and assimilated by a person with normal eyesight. Typical configurations are shown in Appendix A, A.2. Zone VII, the mandatory MRZ, shall be printed with a line spacing as defined in Section 7.4, Figure 8, and a horizontal printing density of 10 characters per 25.4 mm (1.0 in).

## 8. USE OF OPTIONAL BARCODES ON MACHINE READABLE VISAS

### 8.1 Scope

This section defines the specifications governing the use of one or more bar codes on an MRV, at the discretion of the issuing State, to allow expansion of the machine readable data capacity.

### 8.2 Definition

A bar code is defined as a linear or two-dimensional bar code conforming with the specifications defined herein and capable of representing data therein and encoded data read therefrom.

### 8.3 Location of Bar Code(s)

Figures 11 and 12 illustrate the location of a bar code on the MRV-A and MRV-B, respectively, as well as the specifications for the exact placement and overall dimensions of the area to house any optional bar codes. It should be noted that the height and width of the bar code(s) area can vary up to the maximum dimensions shown. In defining these dimensions, the trade-off between optional expanded machine readable data capacity desired and accommodation of mandatory and optional details (VIZ) should be considered.

> **Figure 11. MRV-A with optional linear or two dimensional bar code**
>
> [Diagram showing MRV-A with optional barcode area dimensions: 120.0 (4.72), 78.0 (3.07), 39.0 (1.54), 23.20 ± 1.0 (0.91 ± 0.04), 18.35 (0.72), 3.0 (0.12)]

> **Figure 12. MRV-B with optional linear or two dimensional bar code**
>
> [Diagram showing MRV-B with optional barcode area dimensions: 105.0 (4.13), 70.0 (2.76), 35.0 (1.38), 23.20 ± 1.0 (0.91 ± 0.04), 18.35 (0.72)]

### 8.4 Quality of Bar Code(s)

The bar code(s) included in the bar code(s) area shall meet the overall symbol grade defined for the chosen symbology (symbologies) that allows symbols to be read, following final assembly of the MRV, most times in a single pass.

### 8.5 Symbologies and Logical Data Structure

In order to have the capability to support global data interchange with authorized bodies such as airlines, the bar code symbology selected must offer sufficient data storage capacity to accommodate all mandatory data elements included in the mandatory data groups and in any optional data groups which may be selected from the logical data structure as developed for optional capacity expansion technologies. Furthermore, the associated reading software must be available in the public domain.

### 8.6 Machine Reading of the Bar Code(s)

To enable accurate reading of bar code(s) coexisting with security treatments (e.g. background security printing) in the bar code(s) area, and the use of a single machine reader for reading the MRZ and the bar code(s), where desired by a State, the bar code(s) optionally included on the MRV shall be printed such that the bar code(s) absorb(s) in the B900 band as defined in ISO 1831 (i.e. near infra-red). The bar code(s) may be visually legible.

In determining the placement of the bar code on the MRV, issuing States shall accommodate any special needs or operating conditions of the symbology (symbologies) such as bit area and error correction level. In addition, sufficient marginal space shall be included to accommodate "quiet areas".

Issuing States are encouraged to locate the bar code(s) area nearest to the top edge of the MRZ to allow for possible use of the optical sensing components from the OCR reader, supported by bar code interpretation logic, to accommodate reading of optional bar code data.

The bar code(s) optionally included in the bar code(s) area of the MRV shall not interfere with the accurate reading of data from the MRZ.

## 9. USE OF OPTIONAL DIGITAL SEALS FOR VISA DOCUMENTS

Doc 9303-13 specifies visible digital seals (VDS) for non-electronic documents. In this section the specific rules and requirements for the use of visible digital seals on Visa documents are described.

### 9.1 Content and Encoding Rules

#### 9.1.1 Header

The Document Feature Definition Reference for this use case is 93dec. The Document Type Category for visas is 0x01. Otherwise, the content of the header is the same as defined in Doc 9303-13, Section 3.1.1.

#### 9.1.2 Document Features of a VDS for Visas

The following document features are stored in the seal:

**Machine Readable Zone (REQUIRED)**

The Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) of a visa contains the following information:

- issuing state
- primary and secondary identifiers
- passport or visa number
- nationality of the document holder
- date of birth of the document holder
- sex of the document holder
- validity period (valid until...)

Some States may not issue paper-based visas, but instead use a domestic database to store visa applications, and merely attach a confirmation sticker to the passport. If such States choose to adopt this standard for such stickers, the above information SHALL be encoded as either the MRZ of an MRV-A or MRV-B.

Additionally, the following document features are stored:

**Number of Entries (OPTIONAL)**

The number of times the visa holder may enter the territory for which the visa is valid.

**Duration of Stay (REQUIRED)**

This feature denotes the number of days, months or years during which the visa holder may stay in the territory for which the visa is valid. Note that this is distinct from the "valid until" date of the MRZ, which is already stored in the visa MRZ. First, in most cases, this "valid until" field of the visa MRZ will be the date of expiry of the MRV and indicates the last day on which the visa can be used to seek entry. For some States, this will be the date by or on which the holder should have left. Second, for some issuing States, the stay must be continuous, and for others, the stay can spread over several periods. Thus, to avoid ambiguity during validation, the feature for the duration of stay is required.

**Passport Number (REQUIRED)**

This feature denotes the number of the passport to which the visa sticker is attached. The passport number might already be present in the MRZ. At the discretion of the issuing State, either the passport number or the visa number SHALL be used in the document number field of the visa MRZ; however, the latter option can only be exercised where the visa number has nine characters or fewer. To avoid ambiguity during validation, the field for the passport number (separate from the MRZ) is required.

**Visa Type (OPTIONAL)**

This feature encodes the type of the visa. The field is especially intended to be used, if the type of the visa is not encoded as the second letter of the MRZ.

**Additional Feature Field (OPTIONAL)**

Reserved for future use. This field is OPTIONAL, and intended to store additional verification information in future versions of this standard.

#### 9.1.3 Encoding Rules for Document Features

In the following, the digital encoding of document features of the visa seal is defined.

**MRZ of MRV-A (see Section 4.2.2)**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Tag | 0x01 |
| Min. Length | 48 Byte |
| Max. Length | 48 Byte |
| Value Type | Alphanumeric |

| Content | The first line of the MRZ of an MRV-A (44 characters) and the first 28 characters of the second line of the MRZ of an MRV-A, concatenated and encoded by C40. The filler symbol < in the MRZ is replaced by <SPACE> prior to encoding by C40. |

**MRZ of MRV-B (see Section 7.2.2)**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Tag | 0x02 |
| Min. Length | 44 Byte |
| Max. Length | 44 Byte |
| Value Type | Alphanumeric |
| Required | Required (if visa is of type MRV-B) |
| Content | The first line of the MRZ of an MRV-B (36 characters) and the first 28 characters of the second line of the MRZ of an MRV-B, concatenated and encoded by C40. The filler symbol < in the MRZ is replaced by <SPACE> prior to encoding by C40. |

**Number of Entries**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Tag | 0x03 |
| Min. Length | 1 Byte |
| Max. Length | 1 Byte |
| Value Type | Integer |
| Required | Optional |
| Content | The integer in the range of 0-255dec encodes the number of allowed entries. A value of 0 denotes unlimited entries. |

**Duration of Stay**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Tag | 0x04 |
| Min. Length | 3 Byte |
| Max. Length | 3 Byte |
| Value Type | Integer |
| Required | Mandatory |
| Content | The duration of stay is encoded as specified in Table 1. |

**Table 1. Encoding for the Duration of Stay**

| Integer Values of | | | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | The "valid until" field of the MRZ denotes the last day on which the visa holder may stay in the country for which the visa was issued. |
| 255 | 255 | 255 | The "valid until" field of the MRZ denotes the last day on which the visa holder may seek entry at the border for which the visa was issued. The duration of stay is determined by the authorities at the time of entry at the border. |
| 254 | 254 | 254 | Transit Visa that does not include permission to enter the country of transit. |
| number of days | number of month | number of years | The duration of stay is the sum of the number of days, the number of months, and the number of years, calculated from the time on which the visa holder enters the country for which the visa was issued. The "valid until" field of the MRZ denotes the last day on which the visa-holder may seek entry. The triples (0, 0, 0), (255, 255, 255) and (254, 254, 254), are reserved and, as seen above, MUST NOT be used in this case. |

**Passport Number**

**Additional Feature**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Tag | 0x07 |
| Min. Length | 0 Byte |
| Max. Length | 254 Byte |
| Value Type | Binary |
| Required | Optional |
| Content | Reserved for future use. |

### 9.2 Visa Signer and Seal Creation

With respect to this visa profile, Visa Signer Certificates (VSCs) are issued in a way that allows verification by Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA) certificates. A possible architecture and implementation for the Visa Signer and its client is described in Doc 9303-13, Section 3.2.1. For the security of the visa signing system, see Doc 9303-13, Section 3.2.2

### 9.3 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Certificate Profiles

In general, the requirements from Doc 9303-12 apply. The following deviations apply due to the specific characteristics and properties of visa documents.

Visa specific validity periods are as follows:

- Private Key Usage Time for VSCs: 1 to 2 years

### 9.4 Validation Policy Rules (Informative)

For the validation policy of digital seals on visas, all rules from Doc 9303-13, Appendix D are valid. In addition, the following rules to determine the validity of the digital seal apply.

In addition to the generic Document Validation Policy, the policy for visas considers the following questions:

1. Is the MRZ of the passport valid?
2. Does the MRZ of the passport match with the MRZ of the visa?

Additional visa-specific validation rules for each type of control are given below. In addition, validation criteria, expected results for each criteria, and resulting status sub-indications are listed. See Table 2.

**Visible Digital Seal Validation**

1. **Visa MRZ Validation**
   - if the checksums of the visa MRZ are not compliant with the applicable norm, depending on the visa type, then the status is INVALID with sub-indication INVALID_VISA_MRZ,
   - if there is a mismatch between a field of the visa MRZ and the corresponding document feature stored within the seal, then the status is INVALID with sub-indication SEAL_VISA_MISMATCH. Additional information on the mismatch SHOULD be provided. Otherwise, the visa MRZ validation should continue.

2. **Passport MRZ Validation**
   - If the checksums of the passport MRZ are not compliant with the applicable norm, depending on the passport type, then the status is INVALID with sub-indication INVALID_PASSPORT_MRZ. Otherwise, the passport MRZ validation should continue.

3. **Passport Link Validation**
   - If any of the fields of the passport MRZ listed as follows do not correspond to their equivalent feature stored in the digital seal, then the status is INVALID with sub-indication SEAL_PASSPORT_MISMATCH. The MRZ fields of the passport are: 1) passport number and 2) passport issuing State. Otherwise, if all fields match, the status of the Visible Digital Seal is VALID.

The generic and visa-specific validation rules cover a comparison of the data stored in the seal against data stored on the MRZ of the visa and the passport. Furthermore, a manual inspection of those data that are stored in the seal and printed on the visa, but are not present in the MRZ of the visas, could be conducted.

**Table 2. Recommended Trust Levels of the Visa Policy for Visa specific sub-status indications**

| Status indication | Sub-status indication | Trust level |
|---|---|---|
| INVALID | INVALID_VISA_MRZ | High fraud potential |
| INVALID | SEAL_VISA_MISMATCH | High fraud potential |
| INVALID | INVALID_PASSPORT_MRZ | High fraud potential |
| INVALID | SEAL_PASSPORT_MISMATCH | High fraud potential |

## APPENDIX C TO PART 7 — POSITIONING IN PASSPORT (INFORMATIVE)

### C.1 MRV-A Positioning

> **Figure C-1. MRV-A Positioning**

> [Diagram showing MRV-A placement on passport visa page with MRZ adjacent to reference edge]

Each MRV shall be placed so that:

- the two OCR lines of the MRZ are parallel to the appropriate reference edge of the passport visa page;
- the leading characters of each OCR line are positioned with respect to the left edge of the passport visa page;
- the MRZ is immediately adjacent to the appropriate reference edge of the passport visa page; and
- no MRV may be placed on top of another, nor on the reverse of a page that already has an MRV affixed, nor on the reverse of an MRP data page.

## APPENDIX D TO PART 7 — MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION METHODS (INFORMATIVE)

> **Note 1.** — The following information reflects some past as well as current practices of MRV producers and is included here for guidance only. It is not an endorsement of any product or method.
>
> **Note 2.** — It is the responsibility of the issuing State to ensure that the MRV selected for issue is constructed in such a way that the document will perform satisfactorily for its required life.

Traditionally, visas have taken the form either of a label affixed to a page of the holder's passport or the application of an imprint onto the passport page usually with manual infilling for the personalization. Manual infilling is obviously impractical for machine readable visas where very precise characters for optical recognition are required. There is no fundamental reason why a visa should not be imprinted onto a passport page using a printer capable of printing OCR-B. However, an issuing State that elects to do this will find that many passports, which, of course, are issued by other States, have printed or perforated numbers or other printing on their pages which can absorb the infra-red light used by the document reader and result in a failure to read at border control. In general, therefore, it is better to use a machine readable visa in the form of a label affixed to the passport page.

An MRV can have a life limited to a single entry into a country or it can allow multiple entries over the life of the passport or beyond. The issuing State should ensure that the MRV is appropriately durable for the required life. States should also ensure that their visas are resistant to fraud. States can achieve considerable protection against these threats where border control has access to a central database containing the details of the issuance of genuine visas. However this is not always practicable. The threats are:

- total counterfeiting of the document;
- removal of a visa from one passport and its placement in another;
- alteration of the personal information or validity data.

**Substrate.** Visas have been produced using either paper or a synthetic polymer as the substrate. The substrate should have adequate opacity to prevent any printing or perforations on the passport page affecting the machine reading. The substrate should exhibit no visible fluorescence when irradiated by ultra violet light. Common choices of security features for paper have included: chemical reactants, iridescent plaquettes, fibres (silk and/or synthetics, visible and/or invisible, fluorescent and/or non-fluorescent), and security threads. Synthetic polymer substrates may also incorporate some of these security features. Care must be taken to ensure that any chemical reactants used are unaffected by the adhesive used to affix the visa. It is desirable that the substrate be damaged by attempts to alter the data on the visa or to remove it from the passport. The damage may take the form of tearing or distortion.

**Inks.** Inks that are chemically fugitive, fluorescent, heat sensitive, and optically variable are means of enhancing security in the MRV.

**Printing.** Fine line printing, rainbow (split fountain) printing using guilloche patterns, intaglio printing, and incorporation of concealed images into the design are methods of enhancing both the security and aesthetics of the MRV.

**Adhesive.** Water-moistenable or pressure-sensitive adhesives have been used to affix visas into passports. The selected adhesive should achieve and maintain a strong bond even when heated. The adhesive/substrate combination should be such that the substrate tears or distorts before the adhesive bond fails.

**Die cutting.** Though the final size and shape of the visa is defined in these specifications, the size is too small for most types of visa infilling printers. It is therefore normal for an issuing State to procure visas in a sheet form suitable for the infilling printer with one or more visas contained within the sheet area, the visas being die cut to shape. It is important to ensure compatibility between the sheets of visas and the printer to ensure that the visas do not become separated from the carrier sheet in the printer. It is also important to ensure that the edges of the sheet or of the die-cut shape are not contaminated with adhesive which can build up in the printer and result in misfeeding. Consistency of position of the die-cut shape relative to the edges of the sheet is important to ensure that the machine readable information is placed within the ERZ.

**Personalization.** Most forms of variable image printing, including laser (covered by a laminate), ink jet, dye sublimation and dot matrix printing have been used in the personalization of visas, with the first three used where a portrait is required. To minimize the risk of fraudulent removal of the personalization, the selected combination of substrate and infilling method should achieve a high penetration of the image into the substrate or a strong bond between the material forming the image and the substrate.

**Protecting the personalization.** Protective laminate or lacquer layers may be used to secure the data on the visa. Any laminate material should be firmly bonded to the substrate so that disruption of the substrate or destruction of the laminate material occurs when attempts are made to remove the laminate.

## APPENDIX E TO PART 7 — WORKED EXAMPLE VISIBLE DIGITAL SEAL FOR VISA DOCUMENT (INFORMATIVE)

The following example shows a Visible Digital Seal that results from encoding the data shown in Figure E-1. To generate the signature, ECDSA-256 with the curve brainpoolP256r1 was used. The domain parameters of brainpoolP256r1 and the private key encoded as Base64 are:

```

Encoding input data yields a byte stream, which are both depicted in the image below. Hashing the header and message with SHA-256 and signing them with the above private key gave the following signature (r,s):

- **r:** 21C6785B027EC4A5BFA6DDE537E8ADFA91BEB1197BED97ADF2FF89E0A344512B
- **s:** 7B0136C44050F117E507BC2A782FFE15F68DDD6818AF5A7BAF21CA7CFC7E83BE

For the sake of completeness, the signature as DER encoded ASN.1:

```
3044022021C6785B027EC4A5BFA6DDE537E8ADFA91BEB1197BED97ADF2
FF89E0A344512B02207B0136C44050F117E507BC2A782FFE15F68DDD68
18AF5A7BAF21CA7CFC7E83BE
```

> **Figure E-1. Example Visible Digital Seal for Visa**
>
> [Diagram showing Visible Digital Seal structure with Header and Message zones]

Suppose that seal.bin contains the header and message zone (note that start and length of the signature zone 0xFF and 0x40 are excluded), that the signature is DER encoded in sig.bin, and the above PEM encoded private key in priv_key.pem. The signature can then be verified with openssl by:

```text
openssl dgst -sha256 -prverify priv_key.pem -signature sig.bin -sha256 seal.bin
```
