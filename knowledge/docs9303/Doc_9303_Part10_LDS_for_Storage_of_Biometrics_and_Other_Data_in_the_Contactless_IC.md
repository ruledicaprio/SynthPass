## 1. SCOPE

Part 10 of Doc 9303 defines the Logical Data Structure (LDS) for eMRTDs required for global interoperability and defines the specifications for the organization of data on the contactless IC (Integrated Circuit). This requires the identification of all mandatory and optional Data Elements and a prescriptive ordering and/or grouping of Data Elements that MUST be followed to achieve global interoperability for electronic reading of the electronic passport. [Doc 9303-10](Doc_9303_Part10_LDS_for_Storage_of_Biometrics_and_Other_Data_in_the_Contactless_IC.md) provides specifications to enable States and integrators to implement a contactless IC into an electronic travel document. This part defines all mandatory and optional data elements, file structures, and application profiles for the contactless IC. The Eighth Edition of Doc 9303 incorporates the specifications for the optional Travel Records, Visa Records, and Additional Biometrics applications (known as LDS2 applications) as an extension of the mandatory eMRTD application (known as LDS1).

Part 10 shall be read in conjunction with:
* Part 1 — Introduction;
* Part 3 — Specifications Common to all MRTDs;
* Part 4 — Specifications for Machine Readable Passports (MRPs) and other TD3 Size MRTDs;
* Part 5 — Specifications for TD1 Size Machine Readable Official Travel Documents (MROTDs);
* Part 6 — Specifications for TD2 Size Machine Readable Official Travel Documents (MROTDs);

and the relevant contactless IC parts:
* Part 9 — Deployment of Biometric Identification and Electronic Storage of Data in MRTDs;
* Part 11 — Security Mechanisms for MRTDs;
* Part 12 — Public Key Infrastructure for MRTDs.

## 2. STRUCTURE OF DOC 9303-10

Doc 9303, Part 10 is organized into sections to include:

Specifications common to both LDS1 and LDS2 applications:
* Common attributes;
* All commands for both LDS1 and LDS2; and
* Common Elementary Files (EFs) for both LDS1 and LDS2;

<!-- page 12 -->

Specifications for the LDS1 eMRTD application;

Specifications for the LDS2 applications:
* Travel Records;
* Visa Records;
* Additional Biometrics; and
* Specifications for LDS2 file access conditions.

[Editorial description, not ICAO text: Figure 1, "Applications for both LDS1 and LDS2", is a block diagram of the Master File (MF) with the mandatory LDS1 eMRTD Application DF and the three optional LDS2 application DFs (Travel Records, Visa Records, Additional Biometrics) branching from it, alongside the MF-level files EF.ATR/INFO, EF.DIR, EF.CardAccess and EF.CardSecurity.]

Figure 1. Applications for both LDS1 and LDS2

The eMRTD may support one, several or all of these:
* LDS1 eMRTD application MANDATORY;
* LDS2 Travel Records application OPTIONAL;
* LDS2 Visa Records application OPTIONAL;
* LDS2 Additional Biometrics application OPTIONAL.

<!-- page 13 -->

## 3. SPECIFICATIONS COMMON TO LDS1 AND LDS2

### 3.1 Minimum Requirements for Interoperability

The following SHALL be the minimum requirements for interoperability of proximity contactless IC-based electronic passport:
* [ISO/IEC 14443-1], [ISO/IEC 14443-2], [ISO/IEC 14443-3], [ISO/IEC 14443-4] including all associated amendments and corrigenda;
* [ISO/IEC 10373-6] test specification compliant including all associated amendments and corrigendum;
* Type A or Type B signal interface;
* Support for a file structure as defined by [ISO/IEC 7816-4] for variable length transparent files;
* Support for one or more applications and appropriate [ISO/IEC 7816-4] commands as specified in Doc 9303.

### 3.2 Electrical Characteristics

The radio frequency power and signal interface SHALL be as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-2]. A minimum of 424 kilobits per second transmission speed is advised. Use of the EMD features specified in [ISO/IEC 14443-2] is OPTIONAL.

### 3.3 Physical Characteristics

It is recommended that the size of the coupling antenna area be in accordance with [ISO/IEC 14443-1] Class 1 (ID-1 antenna size) only.

### 3.4 Transmission Protocol

The eMRTD SHALL support half-duplex transmission protocol defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-4]. The eMRTD SHALL support either Type A or Type B transmission protocols, and initialization, anticollision and transmission protocols according to ISO/IEC 14443.

#### 3.4.1 Request Command and Answer to Request

The contactless IC SHALL respond to Request Command Type A (REQA) or Request Command Type B (REQB) with Answer to Request Type A (ATQA) or Answer to Request Type B (ATQB), as appropriate.

#### 3.4.2 Random vs Fixed Identifier for the Contactless IC

The eMRTD may serve as a "beacon" in which the contactless IC emits a Unique IDentifier (UID) for Type A, and PUPI for Type B when initially activated. This might allow identification of the issuing authority. [ISO/IEC 14443] allows the choice of the option whether the eMRTD presents a fixed identifier, assigned uniquely for only that eMRTD, or a random number, which is different at each start of the communication dialogue. Some issuing States prefer to implement a unique number for security reasons or any other reason. Other issuers give greater preference to concerns about data privacy and the possibility to track persons due to fixed IC identifiers.

<!-- page 14 -->

Choosing the one or the other option does not decrease interoperability since a reader terminal when compliant with ISO/IEC 14443 will understand both methods. The use of random IC identifiers is RECOMMENDED, but States MAY choose to apply unique UIDs for Type A or unique PUPIs for Type B.

### 3.5 Command Set

All commands, formats, and their status bytes are defined in [ISO/IEC 7816-4] and [ISO/IEC 7816-8] with the exception of the FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT command. The minimum set of commands to be supported by the LDS1 eMRTD MUST be as follows: SELECT; READ BINARY. It is recognized that additional commands will be required to establish the correct security environment and implement the optional security provisions identified in [Doc 9303-11](Doc_9303_Part11_Security_Mechanisms_for_MRTDs.md). Implementation of the mechanisms specified in [Doc 9303-11](Doc_9303_Part11_Security_Mechanisms_for_MRTDs.md) requires support of the following additional commands: GET CHALLENGE; EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATE/ MUTUAL AUTHENTICATE; INTERNAL AUTHENTICATE; MANAGE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT; GENERAL AUTHENTICATE.

If optional LDS2 applications are present, the eMRTD SHALL additionally support the following commands:

For the Travel Records Application:

READ RECORD; APPEND RECORD; SEARCH RECORD; FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT; PERFORM SECURITY OPERATION (PSO).

For the Visa Records Application:

READ RECORD; APPEND RECORD; SEARCH RECORD; FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT; PERFORM SECURITY OPERATION (PSO).

For the Additional Biometrics Application:

UPDATE BINARY; READ RECORD; APPEND RECORD; SEARCH RECORD; ACTIVATE; FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT; PERFORM SECURITY OPERATION (PSO).

<!-- page 15 -->

Further details on command protocols can be found in [Doc 9303-11](Doc_9303_Part11_Security_Mechanisms_for_MRTDs.md).

#### 3.5.1 SELECT

The LDS1 eMRTD supports two structure selection methods that are file identifier and short EF identifier. Readers support at least one of the two methods. The file identifier and Short EF Identifier is MANDATORY for the contactless IC operating system, but OPTIONAL for the reader.

#### 3.5.2 READ BINARY

The support of the READ BINARY command with an odd INS byte by an eMRTD is CONDITIONAL. The eMRTD SHALL support this command variant if it supports data groups with 32 768 bytes or more.

### 3.6 Command Formats and Parameter Options (LDS1 and LDS2)

#### 3.6.1 Application DF Selection Using the SELECT Command

Applications have to be selected by their DF name indicating the application identifier (AID). After the selection of an application, the file within this application can be accessed.

Note.— DF names have to be unique. Therefore, the selection of an application using the DF name can be done from wherever needed.

##### 3.6.1.1 Selection of Master File

Table 1. SELECT Command for MF Selection

SELECT Command Response

| Data field | Absent |
|---|---|
| SW1-SW2 | '9000' Normal processing Other values to indicate checking or execution errors |

#### 3.6.2 EF Selection Using the SELECT Command

EF is selected by the SELECT command with EF identifier. When the EF is selected, it has to be assured that the application DF storing the EF has previously been selected.

Table 3. SELECT Command with File Identifier for EF Selection

| CLA | '00' / '0C' |
|---|---|
| INS | 'A4' |

| Le field | Absent |

SELECT Command Response

| Data field | Absent |
|---|---|
| SW1-SW2 | '9000' Normal processing Other values to indicate checking or execution errors |


<!-- page 17 -->

The eMRTD SHALL support the SELECT command with file identifier as specified in Table 3. The inspection system SHALL support at least one of the following methods:
* The SELECT command with file identifier as specified in Table 3;
* The READ BINARY command with even INS code and short EF identifier as specified in Table 5.

#### 3.6.3 Reading Data from EF (READ BINARY)

There are two methods to read data from the eMRTD: by selecting EF then reading the data of the selected EF, or by reading the data directly using the short EF identifier. Support for short EF identifier is MANDATORY for the eMRTD. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the inspection system use short EF identifier.

##### 3.6.3.1 Reading Data from Selected EF (Transparent File)

READ BINARY Command Response

| Data field | Data read |
|---|---|
| SW1-SW2 | '9000' Normal processing Other values to indicate checking or execution errors |

#### 3.6.4 Extended Lc/Le Support

Depending on the size of the cryptographic objects (e.g. public keys, signatures), APDUs with extended length fields MUST be used to send this data to the eMRTD chip. For details on extended length field, see [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

##### 3.6.4.1 Extended Length and eMRTD Chips

For eMRTD chips, support of extended length field is CONDITIONAL. If the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes selected by the issuing State require the use of extended length field, the eMRTD chips SHALL support extended length field. If the eMRTD chip supports extended length field this MUST be indicated in the ATS or in EF.ATR/INFO as specified in [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

##### 3.6.4.2 Terminals

For terminals, support of extended length field is MANDATORY. A terminal SHOULD examine whether or not support for extended length field is indicated in the eMRTD chip's ATR/ATS or in EF.ATR/INFO before using this option. The terminal MUST NOT use extended length field for APDUs other than the following commands unless the exact input and output buffer sizes of the eMRTD chip are explicitly stated in the ATS or in EF.ATR/INFO.
* MSE:Set KAT;
* GENERAL AUTHENTICATE.

<!-- page 19 -->

#### 3.6.5 Command Chaining

Command chaining MUST be used for the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command to link the sequence of commands to the execution of the protocol. Command chaining MUST NOT be used for other purposes unless clearly indicated by the chip. For details on command chaining, see [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

#### 3.6.6 EFs Greater than 32 767 Bytes

The maximum size of an EF is normally 32 767 bytes, but some contactless ICs support larger files. A different READ BINARY parameter option and command format is required to access the data area when the offset is greater than 32 767. This format of command SHOULD be used after the length of the template has been determined and the need to access the data in the extended data area has been determined. For example, if the data area contains multiple biometric data objects, it may not be necessary to read the entire data area. Once the offset for the data area is greater than 32 767, this command format SHALL be used. The offset is placed in the command field rather than in the parameters P1 and P2.

Table 6. READ BINARY Command Format When Offset is Greater than 32 767 Bytes

| CLA | '00' / '0C' |
|---|---|
| INS | 'B1' |
| P1 | See Table 7 |

| P1 (b8 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1) | P2 b8 b7 b6 | P2 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0 0 | Selected EF |
| 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | Not all equal | Short EF identifier |
| Not all zero (spanning P1 and P2 b8 b7 b6) |  | X X X X X | EF identifier |

<!-- page 20 -->

Both Length and Value fields of BER-TLV data object are variable length and can be encoded in different ways (see [ISO/IEC 7816-4]: "BER-TLV length fields"). For performance reasons, communication between the eMRTD and the terminal SHOULD be kept as short as possible. Therefore, Length and Value fields in the BER-TLV data object SHOULD be as short as possible. This applies not only for Offset data objects in odd INS READ BINARY commands but also for all other BER-TLV data objects exchanged between the eMRTD and the terminal. Examples for encoded Offset in Data-field:
* Offset: '0001' is encoded as Tag = '54' Length = '01' Value = '01';
* Offset: 'FFFF' is encoded as Tag = '54' Length = '02' Value = 'FFFF'.

The subsequent READ BINARY commands SHALL specify the offset in the Data field. The final READ BINARY command SHOULD request the remaining data area. With respect to [ISO/IEC 7816-4], there are no constraints specified on the offset value when bit 1 of INS is set to 1 to allow a broader use.

Note 1.— In some instances, there are eMRTDs where B1 and the traditional B0 READ Binary commands could not overlap. In other words, B0 only should be used to read the first 32 767 bytes and B1 from 32 K upward. For others there could be a small overlap of 256 bytes around the 32 767 threshold to allow a smoother transition between B0 and B1. For this latter group, B1 could be used right from the beginning of the file, i.e. with an offset starting from 0 to allow the same command to be used to read the full content.

Note 2.— The odd INS byte is not to be used by the inspection system if the size of an EF is 32 767 bytes or less.

### 3.7 Records Handling and Commands (LDS2)

Travel Records, Visa Records and Certificates MUST be stored in EF under the respective applications and have a linear structure with records of variable size. See Figures 4 and 5.

Records within each EF MUST be referenced by a record number. Each record number MUST be unique and sequential (zero referencing the selected record is out of the scope of this document).

Within each EF supporting a linear structure, the record numbers MUST be sequentially assigned when appending, such as in the order of creation; the first record (number one) is the first created record.

The following [ISO/IEC 7816-4] commands MUST be used for records access:

* APPEND RECORD Appending of Travel Records, Visas, Certificates;
* READ RECORD(S) Reading of one or more Travel Records, Visas, Certificates;
* SEARCH RECORD Searching of one or more Travel Records, Visas, Certificates.

<!-- page 21 -->

Note.— Acronyms used in this sub-section are defined in [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

#### 3.7.1 APPEND RECORD Command

The command initiates the appending of a new record at the end of a linear structure.

Table 8. APPEND RECORD Command

| CLA | '0C' |
|---|---|
| INS | 'E2' |
| P1 | '00' (any other value is invalid) |
| P2 | See Table 10 |
| Lc field | Length of the command data field |
| Data field | Record to be appended |
| Le field | Absent |

Table 9. APPEND RECORD Response

| Data field | Absent |
|---|---|
| SW1-SW2 | '9000' Normal processing; '6A84' Not enough memory space in the file; '6700' Wrong length (the record to be appended is longer than the specified maximum length); Other values to indicate checking or execution errors |

Table 10. Coding of P2 in the APPEND RECORD Command

| b8 | b7 | b6 | b5 | b4 | b3 | b2 | b1 | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| x | x | x | x | x | - | - | - | Short EF identifier |
| - | - | - | - | - | 0 | 0 | 0 | Any other value is RFU |

#### 3.7.2 READ RECORD Command

The command returns the full or partial content of one or more addressed record(s) of the selected EF. Depending on the record size and the content of the Le field, the response data field contains one of the following:

* the first part of the addressed record;
* one (or more) full addressed record(s);

<!-- page 22 -->

* one (or more) full addressed record(s) followed by the first part of the next record.

See [ISO/IEC 7816-4] for details and Appendix H for an example of reading a travel record.

Figure 2 illustrates the response data field. The comparison of Nr with the TLV structure indicates whether the unique record (read one record) or the last record (read all records) is incomplete, complete or padded.

Table 11. READ RECORD Command

| CLA | '0C' |  |
|---|---|---|
| INS | 'B2' |  |
| P1 | Record number ('00' references the current record) |  |
| P2 | See Table 13 |  |
| Lc field | Absent |  |
| Data field | INS = 'B2' | Absent |
| Le field | Maximum number of bytes to be read encoded as extended length field; Le = '00 00 00' (any other value is out of scope of the specification) |  |

Table 12. READ RECORD Response

| Data field | Data read |
|---|---|
| SW1-SW2 | '9000' Normal processing; '6A83' (Record not found); Other values to indicate checking or execution errors |

Table 13. Coding of P2 with the READ RECORD Command

| b8 | b7 | b6 | b5 | b4 | b3 | b2 | b1 | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| x | x | x | x | x | - | - | - | Short EF identifier |
| - | - | - | - | - | 1 | x | x | Record number in P1 |
| - | - | - | - | - | 1 | 0 | 0 | — Read record P1 |
| - | - | - | - | - | 1 | 0 | 1 | — Read all records from P1 up to the last |

Note 1.— Other bits combinations are out of scope of this specification. If the Le field contains only bytes set to '00', then the command should read completely either the single requested record, or the requested sequence of records, depending on bits 3, 2 and 1 of P2 and within the limit of the maximum supported length for the extended Le field.

Note 2.— The READ RECORD command with short length fields is out of scope of this specification.

<!-- page 23 -->

[Editorial description, not ICAO text: Figure 2, "Response Data Fields", is a box diagram of two READ RECORD response cases. Case a — complete read of one record (Le field bytes all '00') — shows a "Record" box holding the tag/length/value sequence `5F44 L V`, `73 L V`, `…`, `5F37 L V`, `5F38 L V`, followed by an identical "READ RECORD response (P2 = '04', Le = 0)" box with the same sequence. Case b — read several records up to the end of the file (Le field bytes all '00') — shows adjacent "Record 1", "Record 2", "Record X …" boxes each holding `5F44 L V … 5F38 L V`, followed by a "READ RECORD response (P2 = '05', Le = 0)" box concatenating that same tag/length/value sequence once per record.]

Figure 2. Response Data Fields

#### 3.7.3 SEARCH RECORD Command

The command initiates a search on records stored within the respective EF. The command data field contains Record handling DO'7F76' defining file reference, search configuration and search string (see Table 17). The response data field returns the Record handling DO'7F76' containing one or more DO'02' and containing the record number matching the search criteria within the addressed EF. In an EF supporting records of variable size with a linear structure, the search MAY NOT take into account the records with a search window shorter than the search string.

Table 14. SEARCH RECORD Command

| CLA | '0C' |
|---|---|
| INS | 'A2' |
| P1 | '00' |
| P2 | See Table 16 |
| Lc field | Length of command data field |
| Data field | Record handling DO'7F76' (See Table 17) |
| Le field | '00' (short length) or '00 00' (extended length) |

<!-- page 24 -->

Note.— The response data field may be absent if no match is found.

Table 16. Coding of P2 for the SEARCH RECORD Command

| b8 | b7 | b6 | b5 | b4 | b3 | b2 | b1 | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Search record through multiple EFs |
| Any other value is RFU. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Table 17. Record Handling Template for Enhanced Multiple Record Search

| Tag | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| '7F76' |  | Record handling DO |
| — '51' | File identifier or short EF identifier | File reference DO |
| — 'A1' |  | Search configuration template |
| —— '80' | '00' / '30' | Search configuration parameter: search in record number ascending order; step-width for the search: byte-wise; search termination: '00' - Search all addressed records, '30' - Terminate search after the first match |
| —— 'B0' |  | Search window template |
| ——— '02' | Offset | (within search window template) |
| ——— '02' | Number of bytes | (within search window template) |
| — 'A3' |  | Search string template |

<!-- page 25 -->

| Tag | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| —— 'B1' |  | (within search string template) |
| ——— '81' | Search string |  |

Note 1.— An empty offset DO in the search window template is not supported.

Note 2.— If the search window template makes use of the value '00' for the number of bytes, the LDS2 eMRTD chip MUST search all bytes from the offset in the records.

Note 3.— The SEARCH RECORD command supports only the DOs specified in Table 17. This implies that the SEARCH RECORD command supports exactly one file reference DO in the record handling DO and exactly one search string in the search string template. The command MAY ignore additional DOs or answer with an error code if additional DOs are used.

### 3.8 Transparent Files Handling and Other (LDS2)

The Additional Biometrics transparent EFs are created by the LDS2 eMRTD issuer in the Operational Deactivated state (creation mechanism is out of scope of this specification). In the Deactivated state, the EF can be selected, written, updated and read with appropriate authorizations. The following [ISO/IEC 7816-4] commands MUST be used for writing and reading Additional Biometrics transparent EFs:
* UPDATE BINARY Writing of Additional Biometrics;
* READ BINARY Reading of Additional Biometrics.

The following [ISO/IEC 7816-9] command MUST be used for activating the transparent EF after LSD2 read and write access conditions are successfully satisfied:
* ACTIVATE Activating of Additional Biometrics EF.

Note.— Acronyms used in this sub-section are defined in [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

In the Activated state, the EF can be selected and read with appropriate authorizations (related to the Activated state), and no authorization of any kind allows for writing or appending the transparent EF. The FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT (FMM) command MUST be used before writing to determine if there is enough available memory space in the EF.

<!-- page 26 -->

The IS MUST use the following writing sequence for the EF.Biometrics:
* The first UPDATE BINARY (odd INS) command MUST contain the following DOs in the data field:
  - DO'54' containing the offset '00';
  - DO'53' which MAY contain the first block of the data to be stored. This DO MAY be empty ('53 00'); and
  - Proprietary DO'C0' indicating the total EF size (memory size to allocate) is optional.

Note 1.— The LDS2 eMRTD MAY use the EF size information in DO'C0' for the internal memory allocation (e.g. for explicit dynamic memory allocation). If the LDS2 eMRTD does not support the EF size information DO (e.g., memory has been allocated statically by the issuer, or LDS2 eMRTD supports implicit dynamic EF memory reallocation), then the LDS2 eMRTD MAY ignore the DO'C0', proceed with writing of the first block of the EF and return '9000', or it MAY return the '6A80' error for incorrect parameter in the command data field.

Note 2.— If the LDS2 eMRTD returns any error in response to UPDATE BINARY with the proprietary DO'C0', then the IS MUST send the standard [ISO/IEC 7816-4] UPDATE BINARY (odd INS) command with zero offset DO'54' and DO'53', without the DO'C0'.

* Subsequent UPDATE BINARY (odd INS, without DO'C0') commands SHOULD use the offset n+1 where n denotes the number of bytes written so far to the EF.Biometrics, i.e. the terminal SHOULD sequentially write the EF data without a gap or overlap between the two consecutive UPDATE BINARY commands.
* READ BINARY command MAY be used after any UPDATE BINARY command to verify the data written to the EF.
* The ACTIVATE command MUST finalize EF.Biometrics personalization by permanently disabling writing into the EF.

#### 3.8.1 UPDATE BINARY Command

A contactless IC which supports the Additional Biometrics Application MUST support the UPDATE BINARY command with odd INS byte 'D7' according to Table 18. The value of the BER-TLV Offset Data Object in the command data field specifies the offset; the value of the BER-TLV Discretionary Data Object in the command data field specifies the data to be written; the value of the optional BER-TLV File Size Data Object in the command data field specifies the total EF size. The length fields of these BER-TLV data objects should be encoded as shortly as possible. When the command data field of UPDATE BINARY command has proprietary DO'C0', the bit 8 of CLA byte of command APDU MUST be set to 1 (CLA = '8C').

<!-- page 27 -->

Table 18. UPDATE BINARY Command with odd INS

| CLA | '0C' / '8C' |
|---|---|
| INS | 'D7' |
| P1 | File identifier '00 00' identifies the current EF |
| P2 |  |
| Lc | Length of the command data field |
| Data field | Offset Data Object (tag '54') \|\| Discretionary Data Object (tag '53') \|\| File Size Data Object (tag 'C0') (optional) |
| Le | Absent |

Table 19. UPDATE BINARY Response

| Data field | Absent |
|---|---|
| SW1-SW2 | '9000' Normal processing; '6A84' (Not enough memory space in the file) '6A80' Incorrect parameters in the command data field (e.g., DO'C0 not supported) '6982' Security status not satisfied: The EF.Biometrics is in EF Activated state Other values to indicate checking or execution errors |

If the IS does not follow the UPDATE BINARY sequence as specified in Section 3.8 (i.e. the first UPDATE BINARY does not start at offset 0), the LDS2 eMRTD chip MAY terminate the UPDATE BINARY command with an error.

#### 3.8.2 ACTIVATE Command

The ACTIVATE command initiates the transition of the currently selected Additional Biometrics EF from the Deactivated state to the Activated state.

Table 20. ACTIVATE Command

| CLA | '0C' |
|---|---|
| INS | '44' |
| P1 | '00' |
| P2 | '00' |
| Lc | Absent |
| Data field | Absent |
| Le | Absent |

<!-- page 28 -->

Table 21. ACTIVATE Response

| Data field | Absent |
|---|---|

After successful execution of this command, the currently selected EF.Biometrics MUST be switched to the Activated state. In case an error occurs (SW different from '9000'), the currently selected EF.Biometrics MUST remain in the Deactivated state. Immediately after successful execution of this command (SW1-SW2 = '9000'), the effective authorization required to perform an action on the EF.Biometrics MUST be the one corresponding to the Activated state (according to Table 98). The effective authorization corresponding to the Deactivated state MUST NOT raise any access rights for the EF.Biometrics.

#### 3.8.3 FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT Command

FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT (FMM) command initiates a query of the used or free memory size for the addressed EF. This command is provided for LDS2 eMRTD as proprietary. This command may be used for checking the available free space for the addressed EF before writing or appending. This command may also be used for getting the last appended record number for reading. P1 indicates the EF addressing method, the current EF or file reference DO'51' can be used. P2 indicates the content of the query. The total number of bytes in the addressed EF with transparent or record structure and the number of existing or remaining records for the addressed record EF are provided. The total number of bytes comprises bytes available in the EF without any structural information. This number excludes any structural information that may be required by the LDS2 eMRTD chip. The assumption for the number of remaining records is that the size of all remaining records is at maximum. After a successful FMM command, the referenced EF becomes the current EF.

Table 22. FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT (FMM) Command

| CLA | '8C' |  |
|---|---|---|
| INS | '5F' |  |
| P1 | See Table 23 |  |
| P2 | See Table 24 |  |
| Lc | Absent for encoding Nc = 0, present for encoding Nc > 0 |  |
| Data field | P1 = '00' | Absent |
|  | P1 = '01' | File reference DO'51' (See [ISO/IEC 7816-4]) |
| Le | '00' |  |

P1 specifies the EF selection method. P2 contains a bit map specifying which information MUST be included in the response.

| — '83' | Var | Number of existing records in the addressed record EF |

Note 1.— The LDS2 eMRTD chip MUST return only the Data objects in the FMM DO that are requested by means of P2.

Note 2.— The FMM response data is valid only for the specified EF. FMM response data from different EFs may not be independent, e.g. if different EFs share the available memory. The IS should take this into account if combining FMM response data of different EFs.

Note 3.— When secure messaging is applied to the FMM command, Secure Messaging (SM) DO'85' MUST be used for encapsulating encrypted command data.

### 3.9 File Structure Specifications

Information in an LDS2 eMRTD is stored in a file system defined in [ISO/IEC 7816-4]. The file system is organized hierarchically into dedicated files (DFs) and elementary files (EFs). DFs contain EFs or other dedicated files. An optional master file (MF) may be the root of the file system.

Note.— The need for a master file is determined by the choice of operating systems, LDS1 or LDS2 applications, and optional access conditions.

#### 3.9.1 Encoding of Data

The following types of coding are permitted for the Data Elements: A = Alpha character [a-z, A-Z]; N = Numeric character [0-9]; S = Special character ['<']; B = Binary data; U = UTF-8 encoded UNICODE characters. UTF-8 encoding of UNICODE characters:
* For any character equal to or below 127 (hex '7F'), the UTF-8 encoding uses one byte which is the same as the ASCII value;

<!-- page 31 -->

* For characters equal to or below 2 047 (hex '07FF'), the UTF-8 encoding uses two bytes;
  - The first byte has two high bits set and the third bit clear (i.e. hex 'C2' to 'DF');
  - The second byte has the high bit set and the second bit clear (i.e. '80' to 'BF');
* For all characters equal to or greater than 2 048 and less that 65 535 (hex 'FFFF'), the UTF-8 encoding uses three bytes.

### 3.10 Application Selection — DF

The eMRTDs SHALL support at least one application as follows:
* The LDS1 eMRTD application is MANDATORY;
  - The LDS1 eMRTD application SHALL consist of data recorded by the Issuing State or organization, Data Groups 1 through 16 together with the Document Security Object (EF.SOD);
  - The Document Security Object (EF.SOD) within the LDS1 eMRTD application consists of the hash values as defined in [Doc 9303-11](Doc_9303_Part11_Security_Mechanisms_for_MRTDs.md) and [Doc 9303-12](Doc_9303_Part12_Public_Key_Infrastructure_for_MRTDs.md) for the Data Groups in use, and is needed to validate the integrity of data created by the issuer and stored in the LDS1 eMRTD application.
* The LDS1 eMRTD application MAY optionally support the additional LDS2 applications described in Doc 9303 as:
  - Travel Records Application;
  - Visa Records Application; and
  - Additional Biometrics Application.

In addition, issuing States or organizations may wish to add other applications. The file structure SHALL accommodate such additional applications, but the specifics of such applications are out of scope of Doc 9303.

The LDS1 and LDS2 applications SHALL be selected by use of the Application Identification (AID) as a reserved DF name. The AID SHALL consist of the Registered Application Identifier assigned by ISO according to [ISO/IEC 7816-5] and a Proprietary Application Identifier Extension (PIX) as specified within this document:

The context of LDS1 eMRTD application uses two different tag allocation schemes for application class tag, as defined in [Doc 9303-10](Doc_9303_Part10_LDS_for_Storage_of_Biometrics_and_Other_Data_in_the_Contactless_IC.md) (LDS tag) and [ISO/IEC 7816-6] (Interindustry tag):
* EF.ATR/INFO and EF.DIR use Interindustry tag allocation scheme;
* DFs and their EFs use LDS tag allocation scheme.

Interindustry tags specified in this document are used in LDS context, so coexistent tag allocation scheme is not required.

<!-- page 32 -->

### 3.11 Common Elementary Files (EFs)

The following common EFs for LDS1 and LDS2 applications MAY be existed under the MF:
* EF.ATR/INFO;
* EF.DIR;
* EF.CardAccess; and
* EF.CardSecurity.

#### 3.11.1 EF.ATR/INFO (CONDITIONAL)

EF.ATR/INFO is a transparent EF contained in the master file and is conditionally REQUIRED if the optional LDS2 application is present. This EF is optional if only LDS1 application is present. The short EF identifier at the MF level is '01'.

Table 28. EF.ATR/INFO

Note 1.— Further data objects MAY be present in EF.ATR/INFO.

Note 2.— EF.ATR/INFO uses Interindustry tag allocation scheme as defined in [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

#### 3.11.2 EF.DIR (CONDITIONAL)

EF.DIR is a transparent EF contained in the master file defined by [ISO/IEC 7816-4]. EF.DIR is conditionally REQUIRED if any optional LDS2 applications are present. If any optional LDS2 applications are present EF.DIR MUST be included in SecurityInfos present in EF.CardSecurity. A full description of SecurityInfo for EF.DIR can be found in [Doc 9303-11](Doc_9303_Part11_Security_Mechanisms_for_MRTDs.md). The short EF identifier at the MF level is '1E'.

The file CardSecurity SHALL be implemented as SignedData according to [RFC 3369] with content type id-SecurityObject within the field encapContentInfo. The Security Objects SHALL be signed by the Document Signer. The Document Signer Certificate MUST be included in SignedData. The following Object Identifier SHALL be used to identify the content type:

```asn1
bsi-de OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) reserved(127) etsi-identified-organization(0) 7 }
id-SecurityObject OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { bsi-de applications(3) eID(2) 1 }
```

The data structure SignedData is defined as follows:

```asn1

```

## 4. LDS1 eMRTD APPLICATION (MANDATORY)

The LDS1 eMRTD structure provides space to store and digitally sign mandatory and optional data elements that can be used to link the holder to the document. The information stored in the LDS1 eMRTD portion of the eMRTD becomes static at the time of issuance, and cannot be modified in any possible way. This feature is necessary to ensure that personal information is protected, and that document tampering may be more easily detected. While the LDS1 version of eMRTD includes optional data fields that could be used to expand the use of the eMRTD (i.e. additional biometrics, automated border clearance, etc.), the requirement of write-protecting the LDS1 eMRTD chip application at the time of issuance is MANDATORY.

<!-- page 39 -->

[Editorial description, not ICAO text: Figure 3, "LDS1 eMRTD File Structure Summary", shows the MF with the common files EF.ATR/INFO (SFI '01'), EF.DIR (SFI '1E'), EF.CardAccess (SFI '1C') and EF.CardSecurity (SFI '1D'), and the LDS1 eMRTD Application DF (AID 'A0 00 00 02 47 10 01') containing EF.COM (SFI '1E'), EF.SOD (SFI '1D'), and EF.DG1 through EF.DG16 (SFI '01' through '10'). Because the figure is a diagram rather than running text, the short EF identifiers it prints for EF.DIR/EF.CardSecurity are read from the image and cross-checked against Table 38 below, which is normative text.]

Figure 3. LDS1 eMRTD File Structure Summary

<!-- page 40 -->

### 4.1 Application Selection — DF

The LDS1 eMRTD application SHALL be selected by use of the Application Identification (AID) as a reserved DF name. The AID SHALL consist of the Registered Application Identifier assigned by ISO according to [ISO/IEC 7816-5] and a Proprietary Application Identifier Extension (PIX) as specified within this document:

* The Registered Application Identifier is 'A000000247';
* The issuer stored data application SHALL use PIX = '1001';
* The full AID of the LDS1 eMRTD application is 'A0 00 00 02 47 10 01'.

The IC MUST reject the selection of an application if the extension for this application is absent.

### 4.2 Random Ordering Scheme

The Random Ordering Scheme allows Data Groups and Data Elements to be recorded following a random ordering which is consistent with the ability of the optional capacity expansion technology to allow direct retrieval of specific Data Elements even if they are recorded out of order. Variable length Data Elements are encoded as TLV data objects specified in ASN.1.

### 4.3 Random Access File Representation

The Random Access File Representation has been defined with the following considerations and assumptions. To support a wide variety of implementations, the LDS includes a wide variety of optional Data Elements. These Data Elements are included to facilitate LDS1 eMRTD authentication, rightful holder authentication, and to expedite processing at document/person points. The data structure must support:
* a limited or extensive set of Data Elements;
* multiple occurrences of specific Data Elements;
* continuing evolution of specific implementations.
* support at least one application data set;
* allow for other national specific applications;
* support optional Active Authentication of the document using a stored asymmetrical key pair;
* support rapid access of selected Data Elements to facilitate rapid document processing;
* immediate access to necessary Data Elements; and
* direct access to data templates and biometric data.

<!-- page 41 -->

### 4.4 Grouping of Data Elements

Groupings of Data Elements added by issuing States or approved receiving organizations may or may not be present in an LDS. More than one recording of grouped Data Elements added by receiving States or approved receiving organizations can be present in the LDS. The ability for a receiving State or approved receiving organization to add data to the LDS is not supported in this edition of Doc 9303. The LDS is considered to be a single cohesive entity containing the number of groupings of Data Elements recorded in the optional capacity expansion technology at the time of machine reading. The LDS has been designed with sufficient flexibility that it can be applied to all types of eMRTDs. Within the figures and tables which follow, some data items are only applicable to machine readable visas and to machine readable passports or require a different presentation in relation to these documents. Within the LDS, logical groupings of related Data Elements have been established. These logical groupings are referred to as Data Groups.

### 4.5 Requirements of the Logical Data Structure

The contactless IC capacity expansion technology contained in an LDS1 eMRTD selected by an issuing State or organization must allow data to be accessible by receiving States. ICAO has determined that the predefined, standardized Logical Data Structure (LDS) SHALL meet a number of mandatory requirements:
* ensure efficient and optimum facilitation of the rightful holder;
* ensure protection of details recorded in the optional capacity expansion technology;
* allow global interoperability of capacity expanded data based on the use of a single LDS common to all eMRTDs;
* address the diverse optional capacity expansion needs of issuing States and organizations;
* provide expansion capacity as user needs and available technology evolve;
* support a variety of data protection options;
* utilize existing international specifications to the maximum extent possible, in particular the emerging international specifications for globally interoperable biometrics.

<!-- page 42 -->

#### 4.5.1 Security

Only the issuing State or organization SHALL have write access to these Data Groups. Therefore, there are no interchange requirements and the methods to achieve write protection are not part of this specification. Once the chip has been locked (after personalization and before issuance) no LDS1 Application data can be written, modified, or deleted to/at/from the chip. After issuance a locked chip cannot be unlocked.

#### 4.5.2 Authenticity and Integrity of Data

To allow confirmation of the authenticity and integrity of recorded details, an authenticity/integrity object is included. Each Data Group MUST be represented in this authenticity/integrity object, which is recorded within a separate EF (EF.SOD). Using the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF) structure utilized for Encoded Identification Feature Data Groups 2-4 and optional "additional biometric security" features defined in [Doc 9303-12](Doc_9303_Part12_Public_Key_Infrastructure_for_MRTDs.md), identity confirmation details (e.g. biometric templates) MAY also be individually protected at the discretion of the issuing State or organization.

#### 4.5.3 Ordering of LDS

The Random Ordering Scheme SHALL only be used for international interoperability.

#### 4.5.4 Data Storage Capacity of the Contactless IC

The data storage capacity of the contactless IC is at the discretion of the issuing State but SHALL be a minimum of 32 kB. This minimum capacity is necessary to store the mandatory stored facial image the MRZ data, and the necessary elements for securing the data. The storage of additional facial, fingerprint and/or iris images may require a significant increase in data storage capacity. There is no maximum contactless IC data capacity specified. In the event that a State's PKI infrastructure is not available to sign LDS1 eMRTD data as part of personalization, and the issuance of the document(s) cannot be delayed, it is RECOMMENDED that the LDS1 eMRTD contactless IC be left blank and be locked. The LDS1 eMRTD SHOULD contain an appropriate endorsement on this. This is expected to be an exceptional circumstance.

#### 4.5.5 Storage of Other Data

A State MAY use the storage capacity of the contactless IC in an eMRTD to expand the machine readable data capacity of the LDS1 eMRTD beyond that defined for global interoperability. This can be for such purposes as providing machine readable access to identity document information (e.g. birth certificate details), stored personal identity confirmation (biometrics) and/or document authenticity verification details.

#### 4.5.6 International Standard for Encoding Biometrics

ISO/IEC 39794 succeeded [ISO/IEC 19794:2005] as international standard for encoding biometrics. The following transition time table has been defined:
* inspection systems MUST be able to handle ISO/IEC 39794 data by 1-1-2026 after a six-year preparation period starting on 1-1-2020;

<!-- page 43 -->

* between 2026 and 2030, issuing states and organizations can use the data formats specified in ISO/IEC 19794-X:2005 or in ISO/IEC 39794-X during a four-year transition period. During this transition period, interoperability and conformity testing will be essential; and
* from 1-1-2030 on, passport issuers MUST use ISO/IEC 39794-X for encoding biometric data.

The ICAO Technical Report, ISO/IEC 39794-5 Application Profile for eMRTDs, provides guidance on the transition from [ISO/IEC 19794:2005] to ISO/IEC 39794. Logical Data Structure of eMRTDs includes DG2 for face (mandatory), DG3 for fingerprint (optional) and DG4 for iris (optional). Each Data Group contains biometric data encoded in accordance with the international standards in order to keep international interoperability. All of the above DGs (DG2, DG3 and DG4) MUST use the Biometric Information Template (BIT) group template with nested BITs (see [Doc 9303-10](Doc_9303_Part10_LDS_for_Storage_of_Biometrics_and_Other_Data_in_the_Contactless_IC.md)). The nested BIT structure contains biometric data that can be encoded using one of two types of standards, ISO/IEC 19794 series first edition or ISO/IEC 39794 series. Biometric data encoded in ISO/IEC 19794 series first edition is stored in the data object identified by tag '5F2E'. Biometric data encoded in ISO/IEC 39794 series is stored in the data object identified by tag '7F2E'.

Table 1: Tags for biometric data

| Tag | Standard No. |
|---|---|
| 5F2E | ISO/IEC 19794 series first edition |
| 7F2E | ISO/IEC 39794 series |

Biometric data encoded in the data object identified by tag '7F2E' MUST use the data structure in the table below.

Table 2: Data Structure under DO'7F2E'

| Tag | L | Value |
|---|---|---|
| 7F2E | Var. | Biometric data template defined in ISO/IEC 7816-11. |

### 4.6 LDS1 eMRTD Elementary Files (EFs)

#### 4.6.1 Header and Data Group Presence Information

EF.COM (MANDATORY) EF.COM is located in the LDS1 eMRTD application (Short File Identifier = '1E') and contains LDS version information, Unicode version information and a list of the Data Groups that are present for the application. The LDS1 eMRTD application MUST have only one file EF.COM that contains the common information for the application. The Data Elements that may occur in this template are as follows:

Table 35. EF.COM Normative Tags

| Tag | L | Value |
|---|---|---|
| '60' | Var | Application level information |
| — '5F01' | '04' | LDS Version number with format aabb, where aa defines the version of the LDS and bb defines the update level. |
| — '5F36' | '06' | Unicode Version number with format aabbcc, where aa defines the major version, bb defines the minor version and cc defines the release level. |
| — '5C' | Var | Tag list. List of all Data Groups present. |

A Header and Data Group Presence Map SHALL be included. The header SHALL contain the following information which enables a receiving State or approved receiving organization to locate and decode the various Data Groups and Data Elements contained within the block of data recorded by the issuing State or organization. It is RECOMMENDED that inspection systems that rely on the EF.COM be modified to use the SOD described in the LDS version 1.8 as soon as possible.

##### 4.6.1.1 LDS version number

The LDS version number defines the format version of the LDS. The exact format to be used for storing this value is defined in Section 4.6 of this document. Standardized format for an LDS Version Number is "aabb", where:
* "aa" = number (01-99) identifying the major version of the LDS (i.e. significant additions to the LDS);
* "bb" = number (01-99) identifying the minor version of the LDS.

<!-- page 45 -->

##### 4.6.1.2 UNICODE version number

The Unicode version number identifies the coding method used when recording alphabetic, numeric and special characters, including national characters. The exact format to be used for storing this value is defined in Section 4.7.1 of this document. The standardized format for a Unicode version number is "aabbcc", where:
* "aa" = number identifying the major version of the Unicode specification (i.e. significant additions to the specification, published as a book);
* "bb" = number identifying the minor version of the Unicode specification (i.e. character additions or more significant normative changes, published as a technical report); and
* "cc" = number identifying the update version of the Unicode specification (i.e. any other changes to normative or important informative portions of the specification that could change programme behaviour. These changes are reflected in new Unicode character database files and an update page).

For historical reasons, the numbering within each of the fields (i.e. a, b, c) is not necessarily consecutive. The Universal Character Set (UCS) MUST comply with [ISO/IEC 10646].

#### 4.6.2 Document Security Object EF.SOD (MANDATORY)

In addition to the LDS Data Groups, the contactless IC also contains a Document Security Object stored in EF.SOD. This object is digitally signed by the issuing State and contains hash values of the LDS contents.

Table 36. EF.SOD Tags

| Tag | L | Value |
|---|---|---|
| '77' | Var | Document Security Object |

There are two versions of the Document Security Object EF.SOD which have been deployed. There is the legacy EF.SOD V0 which can be found in Appendix D and the RECOMMENDED EF.SOD V1 in this section. Only one EF.SOD is REQUIRED and allowed.

##### 4.6.2.1 Document Security Object EF.SOD V1 LDS v1.8

The Document Security Object V1 for the LDS v1.8 has been extended with a signed attribute, containing the LDS and Unicode version information:

```asn1
LDSSecurityObject ::= SEQUENCE {
  version LDSSecurityObjectVersion,
  hashAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
  dataGroupHashValues SEQUENCE SIZE (2..ub-DataGroups) OF DataGroupHash,
  ldsVersionInfo LDSVersionInfo OPTIONAL -- If present, version MUST be V1 }
LDSVersionInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
  ldsVersion PrintableString,
  unicodeVersion PrintableString }
```

<!-- page 46 -->

#### 4.6.2.2 SignedData Type for SOD V1

The Document Security Object is implemented as a SignedData Type, as specified in [RFC 3369], Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), August 2002. All security objects MUST be produced in Distinguished Encoding Rule (DER) format to preserve the integrity of the signatures within them.

Note 1.— m = REQUIRED — the field SHALL be present.
Note 2.— x = do not use — the field SHOULD NOT be populated.
Note 3.— o = optional — the field MAY be present.
Note 4.— c = choice — the field content is a choice from alternatives.

| SignerInfo | m |  |
| Version | m | The value of this field is dictated by the sid field. See RFC 3369 [Doc 9303-12](Doc_9303_Part12_Public_Key_Infrastructure_for_MRTDs.md) for rules regarding this field. |
| Sid | m |  |
| issuerandSerialNumber | c | It is recommended that States support this field over subjectKeyIdentifier. |
| subjectKeyIdentifier | c |  |
| digestAlgorithm | m | The algorithm identifier of the algorithm used to produce the hash value over encapsulatedContent and SignedAttrs. |
| signedAttrs | m | Producing States may wish to include additional attributes for inclusion in the signature, however these do not have to be processed by receiving States except to verify the signature value. |
| signatureAlgorithm | m | The algorithm identifier of the algorithm used to produce the signature value and any associated parameters. |
| Signature | m | The result of the signature generation process. |

<!-- page 47 -->

| Value |  | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| unsignedAttrs | o | Producing States may wish to use this field, but it is not recommended and receiving States may choose to ignore them. |

Inspection system MUST accept the field DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers with both conditions, i.e. absent parameters and NULL parameters.

### 4.7 Data Elements Forming Data Groups 1 through 16

Data Groups 1 (DG1) through 16 (DG16) individually consist of a number of mandatory, optional, and conditional Data Elements. The specified order of Data Elements within the Data Group SHALL be followed. Each Data Group SHALL be stored in one transparent EF. Addressing EFs SHALL be by Short EF Identifier as shown in Table 38. The EFs SHALL have file names for these files that SHALL be according to the number n, EF.DGn, where n is the Data Group number.

#### 4.7.1 DATA GROUP 1 — Machine Readable Zone Information (MANDATORY)

The Data Elements of Data Group 1 (DG1) are intended to reflect the entire contents of the MRZ whether it contains actual data or filler characters. Details on the implementation of the MRZ are dependent on the type of LDS1 eMRTD (TD1, TD2 or TD3 formats). This Data Element contains the REQUIRED machine readable zone (MRZ) information for the document in template '61'. The template contains one data object, the MRZ in data object '5F1F'. The MRZ data object is a composite Data Element, identical to the OCR-B MRZ information printed on the document.

<!-- page 50 -->

##### 4.7.1.1 DATA GROUP 1 — EF.DG1 Data Elements for TD1 Size LDS1 eMRTD

This section describes the Data Elements that may be present in Data Group 1 (DG1). Storage, ordering and coding requirements of DG1 are intended to be exactly the same as found in the printed MRZ and described in Doc 9303, Parts 3 and 5. Data Elements and their format within each Data Group area for TD1 SHALL be as in the following table:

Note.— A = Alpha character [A-Z], N = Numeric character [0-9], S = Special character ['<'], F = fixed-length field.

##### 4.7.2.1 Biometric encoding of EF.DG2

DG2 MUST use the Biometric Information Template (BIT) group template with nested BITs specified in [ISO/IEC 7816-11], which allows the possibility to store multiple biometric templates and is in harmony with the CBEFF. The biometric sub-header defines the type of biometric that is present and the specific biometric feature. The nested option of ISO/IEC [7816-11] is always to be used, even for encodings of a single biometric template. The latter case is indicated by numbering with n = 1. Each nested template has the following structure:

Table 44. Data Group 2 — Biometric Encoding Tags

| Tag | L | Value |

The default OID of CBEFF is used. The OID data object (Tag '06') just under Biometric Information Template (BIT, Tag '7F60') specified in [ISO/IEC 7816-11] is not included in this structure. Likewise, the Tag allocation authority is not specified in the structure. To facilitate interoperability, the first biometric recorded in each Data Group SHALL be encoded as per [ISO/IEC 19794-5].

Note.— ISO/IEC 39794 will succeed ISO/IEC 19794:2005 as the international standard for encoding biometrics. See Section 4.5.6.

##### 4.7.3.2.2 Encoding of Zero Instance

States not issuing LDS1 eMRTDs with fingerprints SHOULD NOT populate DG3. DG3 of this structure has the drawback that it will result in a static DG3 hash in the SOD for all LDS1 eMRTDs where the biometric features are not present and populated at the time of LDS1 eMRTD issuance, but the DG3 is declared. For interoperability purposes States supporting fingerprints in their LDS1 eMRTDs MUST store an empty Biometric Information Group Template in cases where no fingerprints are available at the time of LDS1 eMRTD issuance. The template counter denotes a value of '00' in this case. It is RECOMMENDED to add Tag '53' with issuer defined content (e.g. a random number).

<!-- page 60 -->

##### 4.7.3.2.4 Encoding of More than One Instance

To achieve interoperability each feature MUST be stored in an individual Biometric Information Template. The feature position MUST be specified within the CBEFF biometric sub-type if this information is available. The following table contains a worked example for the CBEFF encoding of an interoperable DG3 element with two fingerprint images.

## 5. LDS2 APPLICATIONS (OPTIONAL)

Logical Data Structure 2 (LDS2) is an optional and backwards compatible extension to the LDS1 eMRTD chip that would allow for the digital and secure storage of travel information, after the document has been issued. LDS2 extends the use of the eMRTD through the addition of applications that could allow for the digital storage of travel data (visas and travel stamps), and other information that could facilitate the travel of the holder (additional biometrics), over its validity period. Better leveraging the full potential of the eMRTD by "digitizing" the remainder of the data contained in the documents offers a suite of facilitation benefits, while further protecting the document against vulnerabilities such as counterfeiting, copying and unauthorized reading or writing. The additional and optional applications described as LDS2 are:
* Travel Records (Stamps);
* Electronic Visas; and
* Additional Biometrics.

It is MANDATORY for the LDS1 eMRTD application to be present before any OPTIONAL LDS2 applications may be declared.

### 5.1 Travel Records Application (CONDITIONAL)

The Travel Records application MAY be implemented by an issuing State or organization. The following is conditionally REQUIRED if the optional Travel Records application has been invoked.

[Editorial description, not ICAO text: Figure 4, "Travel Records Structure", is a file-tree diagram: MF (Master File) at the root, branching to five children — DF: Travel Records Application (AID 'A0 00 00 02 47 20 01'), EF.CardAccess SecurityInfos (Short EF Identifier '1C'), EF.DIR (Short EF Identifier '1E'), EF.ATR/INFO (Short EF Identifier '01'), and EF.CardSecurity SecurityInfos (Short EF Identifier '1D'). The Travel Records Application DF itself branches to EF.Certificates (Short EF Identifier '1A'), which in turn branches to EF.EntryRecords (Short EF Identifier '01') and EF.ExitRecords (Short EF Identifier '02').]

Figure 4. Travel Records Structure

<!-- page 79 -->

Entry and Exit Travel Records are stored in two separate Elementary Files EF.EntryRecords and EF.ExitRecords, under the Travel Records application DF with both having linear structure with records of variable size as per [ISO/IEC 7816-4]. Travel Records Signer certificates are stored in a separate Elementary File EF.Certificates, having linear structure with records of variable size.

#### 5.1.1 Application Selection — DF

The Travel Records application MUST be selected by use of the Application Identifier (AID) as a reserved DF name. The AID MUST consist of the Registered Application Identifier assigned by ISO according to [ISO/IEC 7816-5] followed by the Proprietary Application Identifier Extension (PIX) of the Travel Records application:
* The Registered Application Identifier is 'A0 00 00 02 47';
* The Travel Records application MUST use PIX = '20 01'; and
* The full AID of the Travel Records application MUST be 'A0 00 00 02 47 20 01'.

If the effective authorization does not grant access rights to any data in an LDS2 application, selecting this application MUST be rejected by the IC.

#### 5.1.2 EF.Certificates (MANDATORY)

The Travel Records Signer certificates are stored in an EF inside the application DF and have a linear structure with records of variable size. These certificates are intended to be used by the IS to further offline validation of the digital signatures for each record in both the EF.ExitRecords and EF.EntryRecords files.

Table 82. EF.Certificates

| File Name | EF.Certificates |
|---|---|
| File ID | '011A' |
| Short EF Identifier | '1A' |
| Select / FMM Access | PACE+TA (Travel record authorization bit b3 according to Table 96) |
| Read record / Search Record Access | PACE+TA (Travel record authorization bit b3 according to Table 96) |

| Write / Update Record Access | NEVER |
| Erase Record Access | NEVER |
| File structure | Linear structure with records of variable size |
| Size | Variable |

<!-- page 80 -->

The certificate record contains a single LDS2-TS Signer X.509 certificate data object. A Certificate record MAY be referenced by one or more entry or exit Travel Record.

Table 83. EF.Certificates Record Format

| Tag | Content | Mandatory /Optional | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| '5F3A' | Certificate serial number | M | V(22)B | '5F3A' 'Len' {Country code \|\| SerialNumber } |
| '72' | X.509 certificate | M | V (900) B | '72' 'Len' { X.509 Certificate } |

Note.— Interindustry tags specified in this table are used in LDS context, so coexistent tag allocation scheme is not required.

DO '5F3A' MUST contain a two-letter country code according to Doc 9303, Part 3 (same encoding and value as the X.509 issuing countryName on the subject's certificate) followed by the certificate serial number. Each X.509 certificate contains a set of ASN.1 encoded data elements illustrated in Table 84. Detailed requirements for the X.509 Certificate can be found in the certificate profile specification of [Doc 9303-12](Doc_9303_Part12_Public_Key_Infrastructure_for_MRTDs.md).

Note 1.— A = Alpha character [a-z, A-Z], N = Numeric character [0-9], S = Special character ['<'], B = Binary data, F = fixed-length field, V = variable-length field.

Note 2.— Since LDS2-TS Signer certificates are likely to be the same in multiple Travel Records (e.g. when entering and exiting a country through the same airport having only one LDS2-TS Signer), before writing/appending a new certificate to the EF.Certificates, the IS should look up the EF.Certificates for a copy of the same certificate, and reference the existing one. This will reduce the size of EF.Certificates and enable faster lookups.

Note 3.— The LDS2 eMRTD does not enforce that an IS writes Entry Records only to the EF.EntryRecords, but not to the EF.ExitRecords, and vice versa.

Note 4.— Embarkation/Debarkation State three-letter code according to [Doc 9303-3](Doc_9303_Part3_Specs_Common_to_all_MRTDs.md).

The order of the data objects in a record is fixed. The IS MUST build up the record content using the data objects in the order specified in the table. Each Record MUST contain a digital signature (Authenticity Token) calculated over the DO'73', including Tag 73 and Length. Signature is generated by the LDS2-TS Signer.

<!-- page 83 -->

LDS2-TS Signer certificates required to verify the signature of the Travel Record MUST be stored in the EF.Certificates under the Travel Records application DF if not already available in the same file. Travel Records are written (appended) to EF using APPEND RECORD. Travel Records MUST NOT be altered (updated) or deleted. The maximum number of records in each EF allowed MUST be 254.

#### 5.1.4 EF.EntryRecords (MANDATORY)

Entry Records MUST be appended by an authorized IS upon debarkation.

Table 87. EF.EntryRecords

| File Name | EF.EntryRecords |
|---|---|
| File ID | '0101' |
| Short EF Identifier | '01' |
| Select / FMM Access | PACE+TA (Travel record authorization bit b1 according to Table 96) |

| Write / Update Record Access | NEVER |
| Erase Record Access | NEVER |
| File structure | Linear structure with records of variable size |
| Size | Variable |

The structure of the entry record is identical to the structure of the exit record specified in Table 86.

### 5.2 Visa Records Application (CONDITIONAL)

The Visa Records application MAY be implemented by an issuing State or organization. The following is conditionally REQUIRED if the optional Visa Records application has been invoked.

<!-- page 84 -->

[Editorial description, not ICAO text: Figure 5, "Visa Records Structure", is a file-tree diagram: MF (Master File) at the root, branching to five children — Visa Records Application DF (AID 'A0 00 00 02 47 20 02'), EF.CardAccess SecurityInfos (Short File Identifier '1C'), EF.DIR (Short File Identifier '1E'), EF.ATR/INFO (Short File Identifier '01'), and EF.CardSecurity SecurityInfos (Short File Identifier '1D'). The Visa Records Application DF branches to EF.Certificates (Short File Identifier '1A') and a box labelled "EF.ExitRecords" (Short File Identifier '03') — the box's own label reuses the name from Figure 4 even though, per Table 89 below, SFI '03' is normatively EF.VisaRecords.]

Figure 5. Visa Records Structure

Visa Records are stored in the Elementary File EF.VisaRecords under the Visa Records application DF. EF SHALL have a linear structure with records of variable size as per [ISO/IEC 7816-4]. Visa Records Signer certificates are stored in a separate Elementary File EF.Certificates having a linear structure with records of variable size.

#### 5.2.1 Application Selection — DF

The Visa Records application MUST be selected by use of the Application Identifier (AID) as a reserved DF name. The AID MUST consist of the Registered Application Identifier assigned by ISO according to [ISO/IEC 7816-5] followed by the Proprietary Application Identifier Extension (PIX) of the Visa Records application:
* The Registered Application Identifier is 'A0 00 00 02 47';
* The Visa Records application MUST use PIX = '20 02'; and
* The full AID of the Visa Records application is 'A0 00 00 02 47 20 02'.

If the effective authorization does not grant access rights to any data in an LDS2 application, selecting this application MUST be rejected by the IC.

<!-- page 85 -->

#### 5.2.2 EF.Certificates (MANDATORY)

The Visa Records Signer certificates are stored in EF.Certificates inside the application DF and have a linear structure with records of variable size. These certificates are intended to be used by the IS to further offline validation of the digital signature for each record in the EF.VisaRecords.

### 5.4 LDS2 Application File Access Conditions (CONDITIONAL)

#### 5.4.1 Roles and Default Authorization Levels (MANDATORY)

Each CV certificate contains a Certificate Holder Authorization Template (CHAT) that identifies the certificate holder role (IS, DV, CVCA) and contains access rights to DG3/DG4 of the REQUIRED LDS2 eMRTD Application (for legacy reasons or other national uses). CHAT comprises a sequence of two objects:

a) An object identifier specifying the terminal type and the format of the template [TR-03110]:

```asn1
id-roles OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {bsi-de applications(3) mrtd(1) 2}
id-IS OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-roles 1}
```

b) A discretionary data object (tag '53') containing bit-encoded role and read-only access rights of

the certificate holder according to the following table:

Table 95. Default CHAT Authorization

| Field | Description | Byte 1 (b8 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1) |
|---|---|---|

Note.— The LDS2 eMRTD MUST ignore the value of RFU bits in the Certificate Holder Authorization.

#### 5.4.2 Application Authorization Levels (MANDATORY)

Certificate holder authorizations for each LDS2 application are encoded in CV certificate extensions (one extension per application). Certificate extension is a discretionary template (tag '73') comprising two data objects: an Authorization Object Identifier (tag '06') for a specific application and a discretionary data object (tag '53') containing bit-encoded access rights of the certificate holder to a specified application. To determine the effective authorization of a certificate holder, the LDS2 eMRTD chip calculates a bitwise Boolean 'and' of the access rights contained in the certificate extensions of the IS Certificate, and the referenced DV and CVCA Certificates.

<!-- page 94 -->

For the Travel Records application, the Authorization Object Identifiers and access rights encodings are:

```asn1
id-icao-lds2-travelRecords OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-icao-lds2 1}
id-icao-lds2-travelRecords-access OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-icao-lds2-travelRecords 3}

<!-- page 101 -->

The following informative text describes examples of mapping of the Logical Data Structure (LDS v1.7) using a random access representation to a contactless integrated circuit on an eMRTD.

#### A.1 EF.COM COMMON DATA ELEMENTS

The following example indicates an implementation of LDS Version 1.7 using Unicode Version 4.0.0 having Data Groups 1 (tag '61'), 2 (tag '75'), 4 (tag '76'), and 12 (tag '6C') present. For this and all other examples, the Tags are printed in bold, the Lengths printed italics, and the Values are printed in roman. Hexadecimal Tags, lengths and values are in quote marks ('xx').

'60' '16' '5F01' '04' '0107' '5F36' '06' '040000' '5C' '04' '6175766C'

The example would read in full hexadecimal representation as:

'60' '16' '5F01' '04' '30313037' '5F36' '06' '303430303030' '5C' '04' '6175766C'

A hypothetic LDS Version 15.99 would be encoded as:

'60' '16' '5F01' '04' '1599' '5F36' '06' '040000' '5C' '04' '6175766C'

or hexadecimal:

#### A.3 EF.DG2 TO EF.DG4 BIOMETRIC TEMPLATES

DG2 to DG4 use the nested off-card option of [ISO/IEC 7816-11] to have the possibility to store multiple biometric templates of a kind which are in harmony with the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF), [NISTR 6529a]. The biometric sub-header defines the type of biometric that is present and the specific biometric feature.

Example: One signed, facial biometric with the biometric data block length of 12 642 bytes ('3162' bytes), encoded using a device with a PID of '00 01 00 01', using format type '00 04' owned by template provider '00 0A' was captured on 15 March 2002 (no UTC offset) and is valid from 1 April 2002 through 31 March 2007. ICAO patron template Version 1.0 is being used. The total length of the template is 12 704 bytes. The template is stored starting at the beginning of EF.DG2 (SFID 02).

### Appendix B to Part 10 — THE CONTACLESS IC IN AN eMRP (INFORMATIVE)

<!-- page 105 -->

#### B.1 THE ANTENNA SIZE AND CLASS OF AN eMRTD

The antenna size is at the discretion of the issuing State. With the exception of the antenna size, both the LDS1 and LDS2 eMRTD shall fulfil all tests specified in [ISO/IEC 18745-2] applying the Class 1 specifications. It is RECOMMENDED for eMRTDs to be also compliant with Class 1 specifications. There is no mandatory position of the IC, which MAY be placed in an arbitrary position. The location of the contactless antenna is at the discretion of the issuing State as long as it is in one of the following locations: Data page — IC and antenna within the structure of a data page forming an internal page; Centre of booklet — Placing the IC and its antenna between the centre pages of the book; Cover — Placement within the structure or construction of the cover; Separate sewn-in page — Incorporating the IC and its antenna into a separate page, which MAY be in the form of an ID3 size plastic card, sewn into the book during its manufacture; or Back cover — Placement within the structure or construction of the back cover.

#### B.2 BOOTING AND POLLING

An eMRTD brought to an alternate magnetic field of 1.5 A/m as measured in [ISO/IEC 18745-2] shall respond to any REQ/WUP appropriate to its Type after an unmodulated alternate magnetic field of 10 ms. It is RECOMMENDED to be able to respond to any REQ/WUP appropriate to its Type after an unmodulated alternate magnetic field of 5 ms.

#### B.3 ANTICOLLISION AND TYPE

The eMRTD MAY either declare compliance with Type A or with Type B as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-2]. It shall not change its Type unless it has been reset by the eMRTD associated Inspection System.

#### B.4 MANDATORY BIT RATES

The eMRTD shall provide at least the following bit rates, as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-2], mandatorily: 106 kbit/s and 424 kbit/s in both directions between the eMRTD and the eMRTD associated Inspection System. The bit rate of 212 kbit/s, and all bit rates from 848 kbit/s up to 6.78 Mbit/s for both directions, and from 10.17 Mbit/s to 27.12 Mbit/s from the eMRTD associated Inspection System to the eMRTD, as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-2], are optional.

<!-- page 106 -->

#### B.5 ELECTROMAGNETIC DISTURBANCE (EMD)

The support of EMD is not mandatory.

Note.— The EMD feature enhances the robustness of the contactless communication between the eMRTD and the eMRTD associated Inspection System against eMRTD generated electromagnetic disturbance. The eMRTD dynamic current consumption during execution of a command may cause an arbitrary load modulation effect (which may not be purely resistive) on the magnetic field. In some cases, the eMRTD associated Inspection System may misinterpret EMD as data sent by the eMRTD, and this may negatively impact proper reception of the eMRTD response.

#### B.6 (OPTIONAL) SUPPORT OF EXCHANGE OF ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS

The eMRTD MAY support the exchange of additional parameters as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-4] in order to negotiate bit rates higher than 106 kbit/s. It MAY also use the same additional parameters to negotiate frames with error correction as specified in [ISO/IEC 14443-4].

#### B.7 SHIELDING

It is RECOMMENDED to not shield any page of the eMRTD.

#### B.8 (RECOMMENDED) UNIQUE IDENTIFIER (UID) AND PSEUDO-UNIQUE PICC IDENTIFIER (PUPI)

The eMRTD MAY provide a random or fixed UID/PUPI as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-3]. It is RECOMMENDED to use a random UID/PUPI to enhance the eMRTD holder's privacy and to reduce the possibility of tracking.

#### B.9 (RECOMMENDED) RESONANCE FREQUENCY RANGE

There is no requirement on the resonance frequency, of eMRTD Applicants MAY limit the resonance frequency by default to a certain range to increase interoperability.

#### B.10 (RECOMMENDED) FRAME SIZES

The eMRTD MAY support frame sizes of up to 4 kbyte according to [ISO/IEC 14443]. However, it is RECOMMENDED to support frame sizes of at least 1 kbyte. If supporting frame sizes higher than 1 kbyte, the use of frames with error correction as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-4] is RECOMMENDED.

Note.— A higher frame size substantially decreases the total processing time of an eMRTD application.

<!-- page 107 -->

#### B.11 (RECOMMENDED) FRAME WAITING TIME INTEGER (FWI) AND S-BLOCK REQUEST FOR WAITING TIME EXTENSION [S(WTX)]

It is RECOMMENDED for the eMRTD to set an FWI value of less or equal to 11 in order to enhance performance. It is RECOMMENDED to use S(WTX) commands to extend the Frame Waiting Time for each particular command that requires additional time by using S(WTX) commands of an WTXM no greater than 10. In case multiple S(WTX) requests are sent by the eMRTD, the total processing time for the current I-Block is RECOMMENDED to not exceed 5 s.

Note.— Lower FWI values as RECOMMENDED herein decrease the loss of time in transmission errors substantially, whereas S(WTX) are the ideal means of providing more time when needed.

— — — — — — — —

### Appendix C to Part 10 — INSPECTION SYSTEMS (INFORMATIVE)

<!-- page 109 -->

#### C.1 OPERATING VOLUME AND TEST POSITIONS

An eMRTD associated Inspection System shall have an operating volume in accordance with one of the defined Inspection System types in [ISO/IEC 18745-2]. The operating volume is the volume in which all requirements of this technical report are fulfilled.

Note.— The test positions for each Inspection System Type are further specified in [ISO/IEC 18745-2] with respect to the (device) 0 mm surface of the eMRTD associated Inspection System.

#### C.2 PARTICULAR WAVEFORM AND RF REQUIREMENTS

The waveforms of the alternate magnetic field used to communicate shall be fully compliant with [ISO/IEC 14443-2]. In general, there are no exceptions or divergences from the basic standard, except for the field strength. For eMRTD associated Inspection Systems of Type 1, 2 and 3, the field strength is RECOMMENDED to be at least two A/m at all positions for Class 1. For eMRTD associated Inspection Systems of Type M, the field strength shall be at least 1.5 A/m at all positions for Class 1.

Note.— It may be desirable for eMRTDs to also communicate with other contactless Inspection Systems and mobile devices, e.g. NFC smartphones use 1.5 A/m.

#### C.3 POLLING SEQUENCES AND eMRTD DETECTION TIME

The polling sequence of the eMRTD associated Inspection System shall provide 10 ms of unmodulated carrier before any REQA/WUPA or REQB/WUPB. For fast detection and processing, the eMRTD Inspection System:
* Shall poll for Type A and Type B with an equal occurrence of requests for both Types;
* for Inspection System Types 1, 2 and 3, one RF reset should occur in between any REQ/WUP of the same type;
* Shall guarantee at least one polling command for both Type A and Type B within 150 ms for an eMRTD present in the minimum mandatory operating volume according [ISO/IEC 18745-2] at any position.

The eMRTD Inspection System MAY poll for contactless products of any other modulation type on the carrier of 13.56 MHz as long as all the requirements above are fulfilled.

<!-- page 110 -->

Note.— The unmodulated carrier of 10 ms is required to detect all eMRTDs in the field and is based on former specifications.

#### C.4 MANDATORY BIT RATES

The eMRTD associated Inspection System shall provide mandatorily: 106 kbit/s and 424 kbit/s in both directions from the eMRTD to the eMRTD associated Inspection System and vice versa. The bit rate of 212 kbit/s, and all bit rates from 848 kbit/s up to 6.78 Mbit/s for both directions and from 10.17 Mbit/s to 27.12 Mbit/s from eMRTD associated Inspection System to eMRTD as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-2], are optional.

#### C.5 ELECTROMAGNETIC DISTURBANCE (EMD)

The support of EMD is not mandatory.

Note.— The EMD feature enhances the robustness of the contactless communication between the eMRTD and the eMRTD associated Inspection System against eMRTD generated electromagnetic disturbance. The eMRTD dynamic current consumption during execution of a command may cause an arbitrary load modulation effect (which may not be purely resistive) on the magnetic field. In some cases, the eMRTD associated Inspection System may misinterpret EMD as data sent by the eMRTD and this may negatively impact proper reception of the eMRTD response.

#### C.6 SUPPORTED ANTENNA CLASSES

The eMRTD associated Inspection System of Type 1 and Type 2 shall at least support Class 1 eMRTDs in the operating volume. Class 2 and Class 3 are mandatory in ISO/IEC 14443, but optional for eMRTD Inspection System.

[Editorial description, not ICAO text: Figure C-1 shows two ID-3-sized document outlines side by side, labelled "front" and "back", each with a dashed vertical centre line. Each outline contains two nested antenna-position boxes labelled "Cl.2" (outer, Class 2) and "Cl.3" (inner, Class 3), centred on the vertical line. A horizontal dashed line labelled "Half of longer side" runs between the front and back outlines at antenna height, and "Half of shorter side" labels the vertical centre lines.]

<!-- page 111 -->

#### C.7 (OPTIONAL) FRAME SIZES AND ERROR CORRECTION

The eMRTD associated Inspection System MAY optionally support all frame sizes of up to 4 kbytes as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-3]. It is RECOMMENDED to use frames with error correction as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-3] for all supported frame sizes higher than 1 kbyte.

Note.— For eMRTD associated Inspection Systems of Type M, frame sizes higher than 256 bytes are currently not envisaged.

#### C.8 (OPTIONAL) SUPPORT OF ADDITIONAL CLASSES

eMRTD associated Inspection Systems of all Types MAY in addition support Class 4, Class 5 and Class 6 to be interoperable, for example, with mobile devices providing less coupling to the eMRTD associated Inspection System antenna coil.

#### C.9 (RECOMMENDED) OPERATING TEMPERATURE

It is RECOMMENDED that the eMRTD associated Inspection System works with temperatures of -10° to 50° Celsius.

#### C.10 (RECOMMENDED) SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE eMRTDS AND OTHER CARDS OR OBJECTS OR MULTIPLE HOSTS

It is highly RECOMMENDED to design the eMRTD associated Inspection System to handle more than one eMRTD, or one eMRTD and any other card or object compliant with [ISO/IEC 14443]. One of the following rules or a combination MAY be applied, among others:
* apply full anticollision algorithms defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-3];
* check for support of [ISO/IEC 14443-4] and dismiss all non-supporting cards;
* check for an eMRTD application; and
* use Card Identifier (CID) and Node Address (NAD).

Note.— NAD may be also used for mobile devices with multiple hosts.

#### C.11 (RECOMMENDED) FRAME SIZES

The eMRTD associated Inspection System MAY support frame sizes of up to 4 kbytes according to [ISO/IEC 14443-3]. However, it is RECOMMENDED to support frame sizes of at least 1 kbyte. If supporting frame sizes of 1 kbyte or higher, the use of frames with error correction as defined in [ISO/IEC 14443-4] is RECOMMENDED. It is RECOMMENDED to perform any splitting of payload from the application layer into a minimum number of frames with an effective length of the maximum supported frame size with the exception of the last frame.

<!-- page 112 -->

#### C.12 (RECOMMENDED) ERROR RECOVERY

Subsequent to a transmission error or an unresponsive eMRTD, it is RECOMMENDED for the eMRTD associated Inspection System to send a second R-block containing a negative acknowledgement (R(NAK)) according to the Inspection System rule 4 of [ISO/IEC 14443-4].

#### C.13 (RECOMMENDED) ERROR DETECTING AND RECOVERY MECHANISM

When using the optional bit rates as well as optional frame sizes higher than 256 bytes, in case of a higher than usual number of transmission errors, it is RECOMMENDED to reduce the bit rate and effective frame size.

CLA: Proprietary class / no secure messaging
INS: FMM
P1: '01' — EF identifier in command data field
P2: '04' — Return existing number of records in a record EF
Lc: '04'
Data: DO'51' containing Entry Records EF identifier '0101'
Le: '00' (Short Le)
Response: FILE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT DO representing the number of records in the EF.

| Data | SW1-SW2 |
|---|---|
| '7F78 03' '83 01 FD' | '90 00' |

The DO in the response data contains the last record number which can be used in the next READ RECORD command (P1). For example, the last record number '00' means that there are no records in this file, and the response 'FD' means that the number of records is 253 (the maximum number of records is 254).

#### H.2 READ RECORD COMMAND RETRIEVING THE LAST TRAVEL RECORD FROM THE RETRIEVED LIST

The following command can be used to retrieve a single record using the record number returned by the FMM command:

| CLA | INS | P1 | P2 | Le |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| '00' | 'B2' | 'FD' | '04' | '00 00 00' |

| '62 82' |

If an EF.Certificate record matches the search criteria, the IS can optionally use the returned record number ('01') in a READ RECORD command to check whether the certificate is the correct one. If no EF.Certificate record matches the search criteria, the IS writes the certificate into EF.Certificates using the APPEND RECORD command in Section J.2 and finally writes the entry record using the APPEND RECORD command in Section J.3.

#### J.2 APPEND RECORD COMMAND WRITING CERTIFICATE

IS writes LDS2-TS Signer certificate into EF.Certificates. The following command can be used for writing certificates:

| CLA | INS | P1 | P2 | Lc | Data | Le |
