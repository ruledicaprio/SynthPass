## 1. SCOPE

Part 11 to Doc 9303 provides specifications to enable States and suppliers to implement cryptographic security features for electronic machine readable travel documents (“eMRTDs”) offering contactless integrated circuit (IC) access. Cryptographic protocols are specified to:

* prevent skimming of data from the contactless IC;
* prevent eavesdropping on the communication between contactless IC and reader;
* provide authentication of the data stored on the contactless IC based on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) described in Part 12; and
* provide authentication of the contactless IC itself.

The Eighth Edition of Doc 9303 incorporates the specifications for the optional Travel Records, Visa Records, and Additional Biometrics applications (known as LDS2 applications) as an optional extension of the eMRTD. This part of Doc 9303 includes the necessary extended access control protocols to protect writing and reading of the data of the respective LDS2 applications. These access control protocols may also be used for the protection of the secondary biometrics in the eMRTD Application.

The authentication of the data stored on the contactless IC is the basic security feature to enable the use of the IC for manual and/or automated inspection. This feature is therefore REQUIRED.

Implementation of a protocol to prevent skimming of the data stored on the contactless IC and to prevent eavesdropping on the communication between IC and terminal is REQUIRED.

Implementation of the other protocols is OPTIONAL, allowing the issuing State or organization to decide on the necessary set of security features according to national regulations/demands.

This part shall be read in conjunction with the following Parts of Doc 9303:

* Part 1 — Introduction;
* Part 10 — Logical Data Structure (LDS) for Storage of Biometrics and Other Data in the Contactless Integrated Circuit (IC); and
* Part 12 — Public Key Infrastructure for MRTDs.

## 2. ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATIONS

It is assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with the concepts and mechanisms offered by public key cryptography and public key infrastructures.

While the use of public key cryptography techniques adds some complexity to the implementation of eMRTDs, such techniques add value in that they will provide front-line border control points with an additional measure to determine the authenticity of the eMRTD. It is assumed that the use of such a technique is not the sole measure for determining authenticity and it SHOULD NOT be relied upon as a single determining factor.

<!-- page 12 -->

In the event that the data from the contactless IC cannot be used, for instance as a result of a certificate revocation or an invalid signature verification, or if the contactless IC was left intentionally blank (see Section 4.5.4 of Doc 9303-10), the eMRTD is not necessarily invalidated. In such cases a receiving State MAY rely on other document security features for validation purposes.

### 2.1 Requirements for eMRTD Chips and Terminals

This part of Doc 9303 specifies requirements for implementations of eMRTD chips (or, equivalently, IC) and terminals (or inspection systems). While eMRTD chips must comply with those requirements according to the terminology described in Doc 9303-1, requirements for terminals are to be interpreted as guidance, i.e. interoperability of eMRTD chip and terminal are only guaranteed if the terminal complies with those requirements, otherwise the interaction with the eMRTD chip will either fail or the behaviour of the eMRTD chip is undefined. In general, the eMRTD chip need not enforce requirements related to terminals unless the security of the eMRTD chip is directly affected.

### 2.2 Notations

The following notations are used to denote cryptographic primitives in an algorithm independent way:

* Encryption of clear text S with symmetric key K: E(K, S);
* Decryption of cipher text C with symmetric key K: D(K, C);
* The operation for computing a hash over a message m is denoted by H(m).
* Computing a Message Authentication Code with symmetric key K over message M: MAC(K ,M);
* Key agreement based on asymmetric key pairs (SK, PK) and (SK’, PK’) and domain parameters D: KA(SK,PK’,D) / KA(SK’,PK,D);
* Key derivation from a shared secret S: KDF (S);
* Signing a message m with private key SKIFD is denoted by s = Sign(SKIFD, m);
* Verifying the resulting signature s with public key PKIFD and message m: Verify(PKIFD, s, m).
* Computing a compressed representation of a public key PK: Comp(PK).

<!-- page 13 -->

## 3. SECURING ELECTRONIC DATA

Besides Passive Authentication by digital signatures and Chip Access Control, issuing States or organizations MAY choose additional security, using more complex ways of securing the contactless IC and its data.

Accessing an eMRTD comprises the following steps:

1. Gain access to the contactless IC of the eMRTD (Section 4)

2. Authentication of data (Section 5)

3. Authentication of the chip (Section 6)

4. Additional access control mechanisms (Section 7)

5. Reading data (see Doc 9303-10).

Different protocols are available for the different steps. The exact configuration of an eMRTD is chosen by the issuing State or organization. The options given in Table 1 can be suitably combined to achieve additional security according to the requirements of issuers.

Inspection Procedures for different configurations of eMRTDs are described in Appendix J.

Note.— See Section 4 for details on compliant configurations of contactless ICs with respect to the implementation of Basic Access Control and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment.

Implementation of advanced security methods as listed in Table 1 does not affect ICAO compliance.

## 4. ACCESS TO THE CONTACTLESS IC

Adding a contactless IC without access control to an eMRTD introduces two new attack possibilities:

* the data stored in the contactless IC can be electronically read without authorizing this reading of the document (skimming); and
* the unencrypted communication between a contactless IC and a reader can be eavesdropped within a distance of several metres.

<!-- page 15 -->

While there are physical measures possible against skimming (e.g. shielding using a metal mesh in the cover of a passport booklet), these do not address eavesdropping. Therefore, it is understood that issuing States or organizations SHALL implement a Chip Access Control mechanism, i.e. an access control mechanism that in effect requires the knowledge of the bearer of the eMRTD that the data stored in the contactless IC is being read in a secure way. This Chip Access Control mechanism prevents skimming as well as eavesdropping.

A contactless IC that is protected by a Chip Access Control mechanism denies access to its contents unless the inspection system can prove that it is authorized to access the contactless IC. This proof is given in a cryptographic protocol, where the inspection system proves knowledge of the information derived from the physical document.

The inspection system MUST be provided with this information prior to being able to read the contactless IC. The information has to be retrieved optically/visually from the eMRTD (e.g. from the MRZ). It also MUST be possible for an inspector to enter this information manually in the inspection system in case machine-reading of the information is not possible.

Assuming that the information from the physical document cannot be obtained from an unviewed document (e.g. since the information is derived from the optically read MRZ), it is accepted that the eMRTD was knowingly handed over for inspection. Due to the encryption of the channel, eavesdropping on the communication would require a considerable effort.

This section defines two mechanisms for Chip Access Control:

* Basic Access Control (BAC, Section 4.3), which is based purely on symmetric cryptography; and
* Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE, Section 4.4), which employs asymmetric cryptography to provide higher entropy session keys.

See also Appendix A for additional information on the strength of session keys.

### 4.1 Compliant Configurations

The following configurations comply with this specification:

* eMRTD chips implementing BAC only;
* eMRTD chips implementing PACE and BAC;
* eMRTD chips implementing PACE only.

The security provided by Basic Access Control is limited by the design of the protocol, as explained in Appendix A. It is anticipated that increased computer power over the years will enable attacks against BAC that can be successfully performed with reasonable financial means and within reasonable time. Therefore, a gradual change over from BAC to PACE is agreed.

The following transition period has been defined:

* Issuing States and organizations issuing eMRTDs SHALL implement PACE as of 1 January 2027, i.e., the chip of eMRTDs issued as of 1 January 2027 SHALL implement one of the following configurations:
* eMRTD chips implementing PACE and BAC; -eMRTD chips implementing PACE only.
* Issuing States and organizations SHALL NOT issue eMRTDs with BAC as of 1 January 2028, i.e., the chip of eMRTDS issued as of 1 January 2028 SHALL implement the following configuration:
* eMRTD chips implementing PACE only.
* Issuing States and organizations SHALL ensure that all eMRTDs with BAC are out of circulation by 1 January 2038. This applies to both eMRTD chips implementing BAC only and eMRTD chips implementing PACE and BAC.

<!-- page 16 -->

Compliant inspection systems MUST support all compliant eMRTD configurations. If an eMRTD supports both PACE and BAC, the inspection system SHALL use either BAC or PACE but not both in the same session.

Note 1.— Previous versions of Doc 9303 allowed eMRTD chips implementing no Chip Access Control (“plain eMRTDs”). This is deprecated in the Eighth Edition. Nevertheless, compliant inspection systems MUST support eMRTDs without Chip Access Control.

Note 2.— For access to LDS2 applications, the IC MUST require the execution of PACE.

### 4.2 Chip Access Procedure

The chip access procedure to authenticate the inspection system consists of the following steps.

1. Read EF.CardAccess (REQUIRED)

If PACE is supported by the eMRTD, the eMRTD chip MUST provide the parameters to be used for PACE in the file EF.CardAccess.

If EF.CardAccess is available, the inspection system SHALL read the file EF.CardAccess (cf. Section 9.2.11) to determine the parameters (i.e. symmetric ciphers, key agreement algorithms, domain parameters, and mappings) supported by the eMRTD chip. The inspection system may select any of those parameters.

If the file EF.CardAccess is not available or does not contain parameters for PACE, the inspection system SHOULD try to read the eMRTD with Basic Access Control (skip to Step 4).

2. Read EF.DIR (OPTIONAL)

The Inspection System MAY read EF.DIR (if present) to retrieve a list of applications present on the eMRTD chip.

3. PACE (CONDITIONAL)

This step is RECOMMENDED if PACE is supported by the eMRTD chip. This step is REQUIRED if access to LDS2 applications is intended.

* The inspection system SHOULD derive the key Kπ from the MRZ. It MAY use the CAN instead of the MRZ if the CAN is known to the inspection system.
* The eMRTD chip SHALL accept the MRZ as passwords for PACE. It MAY additionally accept the CAN instead of the MRZ.
* The inspection system and the eMRTD chip mutually authenticate using Kπ and derive session keys KSEnc and KSMAC. The PACE protocol as described in Section 4.4 SHALL be used.

If successful, the eMRTD chip performs the following:

* It SHALL start Secure Messaging.
* It SHALL grant access to less sensitive data (e.g. EF.DG1, EF.DG2, EF.DG14, EF.DG15, etc. of the eMRTD Application, and the Document Security Object. For the definition of “sensitive data” see Doc 9303-1).
* It SHALL restrict access rights to require Secure Messaging.

<!-- page 17 -->

The inspection system MUST verify the authenticity of the contents of EF.CardAccess using EF.DG14 or EF.CardSecurity, and of EF.DIR (if present and read) using EF.CardSecurity.

Note.— If no LDS2 application is present on the eMRTD chip, EF.CardSecurity may not contain a secured copy of EF.DIR.

4. Basic Access Control (CONDITIONAL)

This step is REQUIRED if Chip Access Control is enforced by the eMRTD chip and PACE has not been used. If PACE was successfully performed or if the eMRTD does not enforce Chip Access Control, this step is skipped.

The eMRTD Application MUST be selected before Basic Access Control is performed.

* The inspection system SHOULD derive the Document Basic Access Keys (KEnc and KMAC) from the MRZ.
* The inspection system and the eMRTD chip mutually authenticate using the Document Basic Access Keys and derive session keys KSEnc and KSMAC.

If successful, the eMRTD chip performs the following:

* It SHALL start Secure Messaging.
* It SHALL grant access to less sensitive data (e.g. EF.DG1, EF.DG2, EF.DG14, EF.DG15, etc. of the eMRTD Application, and the Document Security Object).
* It SHALL restrict access rights to require Secure Messaging.

Note.— As a result of the Chip Access Procedure, the Current DF can be either the Master File (if PACE was used) or the eMRTD Application (if BAC was used).

### 4.3 Basic Access Control

#### 4.3.1 Protocol Specification

Authentication and Key Establishment is provided by a three-pass challenge-response protocol according to [ISO/IEC 11770-2] Key Establishment Mechanism 6 using 3DES [FIPS 46-3] as block cipher. A cryptographic checksum according to [ISO/IEC 9797-1] MAC Algorithm 3 is calculated over and appended to the ciphertexts. The modes of operation described in Section 4.3.3 MUST be used. Exchanged nonces MUST be of size 8 bytes, exchanged keying material MUST be of size 16 bytes. The IFD (i.e. the inspection system) and the contactless IC MUST NOT use distinguishing identifiers as nonces.

In more detail, IFD and IC SHALL perform the following steps:

1) The IFD requests a challenge RND.IC by sending the GET CHALLENGE command. The IC generates and responds with a nonce RND.IC.

<!-- page 18 -->

2) The IFD performs the following operations:

a) generate a nonce RND.IFD and keying material K.IFD.

b) generate the concatenation S = RND.IFD || RND.IC || K.IFD.

compute the cryptogram EIFD = E(KEnc, S).

compute the checksum MIFD = MAC(KMAC, EIFD).

e) send the EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATE command with mutual authenticate function using the data EIFD || MIFD.

3) The IC performs the following operations:

a) check the checksum MIFD of the cryptogram EIFD.

b) decrypt the cryptogram EIFD.

extract RND.IC from S and check if IFD returned the correct value.

generate keying material K.IC.

e) generate the concatenation R = RND.IC || RND.IFD || K.IC.

f) compute the cryptogram EIC = E(KEnc, R).

g) compute the checksum MIC = MAC(KMAC, EIC).

h) send the response using the data EIC || MIC.

4) The IFD performs the following operations:

a) check the checksum MIC of the cryptogram EIC.

b) decrypt the cryptogram EIC.

extract RND.IFD from R and check if IC returned the correct value.

5) The IFD and the IC derive session keys KSEnc and KSMAC using the key derivation mechanism described in Sections 9.7.1. and 9.7.4 with (K.IC xor K.IFD) as shared secret.

#### 4.3.2 Inspection Process

When an eMRTD with Basic Access Control is offered to the inspection system, optically or visually read information is used to derive the Document Basic Access Keys (KEnc and KMAC) to gain access to the contactless IC and to set up a secure channel for communications between the eMRTD’s contactless IC and the inspection system.

An eMRTD’s contactless IC that supports Basic Access Control MUST respond to unauthenticated read attempts, i.e. read attempts sent without Secure Messaging (including selection of (protected) files in the LDS), with “Security status not satisfied” (0x6982) once the Secure Channel is established. If the IC receives a plain SELECT, i.e. without Secure

<!-- page 19 -->

Messaging applied, in the Secure Channel, the IC SHALL abort the Secure Channel. When a plain SELECT is sent before the Secure Channel is established, or when the Secure Channel has been aborted, both 0x6982 and 0x9000 MAY be returned by the IC, i.e., are ICAO-compliant responses.

To authenticate the inspection system the following steps MUST be performed:

1) The inspection system reads the “MRZ_information”. The “MRZ_information” consists of the concatenation of Document Number, Date of Birth and Date of Expiry, including their respective check digits, as described in Doc 9303-4, Doc 9303-5 or Doc 9303-6 for document form factors TD3, TD1 and TD2, respectively, from the MRZ using an OCR-B reader. Alternatively, the required information can be typed in; in this case it SHALL be typed in as it appears in the MRZ. The most significant 16 bytes of the SHA-1 hash of this “MRZ_information” are used as key seed to derive the Document Basic Access Keys using the key derivation mechanism described in Section 9.7.2.

2) The inspection system and the eMRTD’s contactless IC mutually authenticate and derive session keys. The authentication and key establishment protocol described above MUST be used.

3) After a successful execution of the authentication protocol both the IFD and the IC compute session keys KSEnc and KSMAC using the key derivation mechanism described in Sections 9.7.1 and 9.7.4 with (K.IC xor K.IFD) as shared secret. All subsequent communication MUST be protected by Secure Messaging as described in Section 9.8.

#### 4.3.3 Cryptographic Specifications

##### 4.3.3.1 Encryption of Challenge and Response

Two key 3DES in CBC mode with zero IV (i.e. 0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00) according to [ISO/IEC 11568-2] SHALL be used for computation of EIFD and EIC. Padding for the input data MUST NOT be used when performing the EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATE command.

##### 4.3.3.2 Authentication of Challenge and Response

The cryptographic checksums MIFD and MIC SHALL be calculated using [ISO/IEC 9797-1] MAC algorithm 3 with block cipher DES, zero IV (8 bytes), and [ISO/IEC 9797-1] padding method 2. The MAC length MUST be 8 bytes.

#### 4.3.4 Application Protocol Data Units

Basic Access Control is performed using the commands GET CHALLENGE and EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATE with mutual authenticate function. The commands SHALL be encoded as specified in [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

### 4.4 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment

PACE is a password authenticated Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol that provides secure communication and password-based authentication of the eMRTD chip and the inspection system (i.e. eMRTD chip and inspection system share the same password π).

<!-- page 21 -->

PACE establishes Secure Messaging between an eMRTD chip and an inspection system based on weak (short) passwords. The security context is established in the Master File. The protocol enables the eMRTD chip to verify that the inspection system is authorized to access stored data and has the following features:

* Strong session keys are provided independent of the strength of the password.
* The entropy of the password(s) used to authenticate the inspection system can be very low (e.g. 6 digits are sufficient in general).

PACE uses keys Kπ derived from passwords with a key derivation function KDFπ (cf. Section 9.7.3). For globally interoperable machine readable travel documents the following two passwords and corresponding keys are available:

* MRZ: The key Kπ defined by Kπ = KDFπ(MRZ) is REQUIRED. It is derived from the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) similar to Basic Access Control, i.e. the key is derived from the Document Number, the Date of Birth and the Date of Expiry.
* CAN: The key Kπ defined by Kπ = KDFπ(CAN) is OPTIONAL. It is derived from the Card Access Number (CAN). The CAN is a number printed on the document and MUST be chosen randomly or pseudo-randomly (e.g. using a cryptographically strong pseudo-random function). Doc 9303, Parts 4, 5 and 6 specify the CAN field.

Note.— In contrast to the MRZ (Document Number, Date of Birth, Data of Expiry) the CAN has the advantage that it can easily be typed in manually.

PACE supports different Mappings as part of the protocol execution:

* Generic Mapping based on a Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement;
* Integrated Mapping based on a direct mapping of a field element to the cryptographic group;
* Chip Authentication Mapping extends the Generic Mapping and integrates Chip Authentication into the PACE protocol.

If the chip supports Chip Authentication Mapping, at least one of Generic Mapping or Integrated Mapping and Chip Authentication MUST also be supported by the chip. This implies that for inspection systems supporting PACE, only support for Generic Mapping and Integrated Mapping is REQUIRED. Support for Chip Authentication Mapping is OPTIONAL.

#### 4.4.1 Protocol Specification

The inspection system reads the parameters for PACE supported by the eMRTD chip from the file EF.CardAccess (cf. Section 9.2.11) and selects the parameters to be used, followed by the protocol execution.

The following commands SHALL be used:

* READ BINARY as specified in Doc 9303-10;
* MSE:Set AT (MANAGE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT command with Set Authentication Template function) as specified in Section 4.4.4.1;
* The following steps SHALL be performed by the inspection system and the eMRTD chip using a chain of GENERAL AUTHENTICATE commands as specified in Section 4.4.4.2:

<!-- page 22 -->

1) The eMRTD chip randomly and uniformly chooses a nonce s, encrypts the nonce to z = E(Kπ,s), where Kπ = KDFπ (π) is derived from the shared password π, and sends the ciphertext z to the inspection system.

2) The inspection system recovers the plaintext s = D(Kπ,z) with the help of the shared password π.

3) Both the eMRTD chip and the inspection system perform the following steps:

a) They exchange additional data required for the mapping of the nonce:

for the generic mapping, the eMRTD chip and the inspection system exchange ephemeral key public keys.

for the integrated mapping, the inspection system sends an additional nonce to the eMRTD chip.

b) They compute the ephemeral domain parameters D = Map(DIC,s,…) as described in Section 4.4.3.3.

They perform an anonymous Diffie-Hellman key agreement (cf. Section 9.6) based on the ephemeral domain parameters and generate the shared secret K = KA(SKDH,IC, PKDH,IFD,D) = KA(SKDH,IFD, PKDH,IC,D).

During Diffie-Hellman key agreement, the IC and the inspection system SHOULD check that the two public keys PKDH,IC and PKDH,IFD differ.

e) They derive session keys KSMAC = KDFMAC(K) and KSEnc = KDFEnc(K) as described in Section 9.7.1.

f) They exchange and verify the authentication token TIFD = MAC(KSMAC,PKDH,IC) and TIC = MAC(KSMAC,PKDH,IFD) as described in Section 4.4.3.4.

4) Conditionally, the eMRTD chip computes Chip Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them to the terminal (cf. Section 4.4.3.5.1). The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC (cf. Section 4.4.3.5.2).

#### 4.4.2 Security Status

An eMRTD chip that supports PACE SHALL respond to unauthenticated read attempts (including selection of (protected) files in the LDS) with “Security status not satisfied” (0x6982).

Note.— This specification is more restrictive than the corresponding specification for BAC-only eMRTDs.

If PACE was successfully performed then the eMRTD chip has verified the used password. Secure Messaging is started using the derived session keys KSMAC and KSEnc.

#### 4.4.3 Cryptographic Specifications

This section contains the cryptographic details of the specification.

Particular algorithms are selected by the issuing State or organization. The inspection system MUST support all combinations described in the following subsections, with the exception of Chip Authentication Mapping, which is OPTIONAL. The eMRTD chip MAY support more than one combination of algorithms.

Note 1.— Some algorithms are not available for the Chip Authentication Mapping: For security reasons, the use of 3DES is no longer recommended. DH-variants are not available to reduce the number of variants to be implemented by Terminals.

Note 2.— 3DES may become deprecated for the Generic Mapping and the Integrated Mapping in the future.

##### 4.4.3.3 Encrypting and Mapping Nonces

The eMRTD chip SHALL randomly and uniformly select the nonce s as a binary bit string of length l, where l is a multiple of the block size in bits of the respective block cipher E() chosen by the eMRTD chip.

* The nonce s SHALL be encrypted in CBC mode according to [ISO/IEC 10116] using the key Kπ = KDFπ(π) derived from the password π and IV set to the all-0 string.
* The nonce s SHALL be converted to a random generator using an algorithm-specific mapping function Map.
* For the Integrated Mapping the additional nonce t SHALL be selected randomly and uniformly as a binary bit string of length k and sent in clear. In this case k is the key size in bits of the respective block cipher E() and l SHALL be the smallest multiple of the block size of E() such that l ≥ k.

To map the nonce s or the nonces s, t into the cryptographic group one of the following mappings SHALL be used:

* Generic Mapping (Section 4.4.3.3.1);
* Integrated Mapping (Section 4.4.3.3.2);
* Chip Authentication Mapping (Section 4.4.3.3.3).

<!-- page 26 -->

4.4.3.3.1 Generic Mapping

ECDH

The function Map:G → Ĝ is defined as Ĝ = s×G+H, where H in <G> is chosen such that logGH is unknown. The point H SHALL be calculated by an anonymous Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement [TR-03111] as H = KA(SKMap,IC, PKMap,IFD, DIC) = KA(SKMap,IFD, PKMap, IC, DIC).

Note.— The key agreement algorithm ECKA prevents small subgroup attacks by using compatible cofactor multiplication.

DH

The function Map:g → ĝ is defined as ĝ =gs×h, where h in <g> is chosen such that loggh is unknown. The group element h SHALL be calculated by an anonymous Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement as h = KA(SKMap,IC, PKMap,IFD, DIC) = KA(SKMap,IFD, PKMap,IC, DIC).

Note.— The public key validation method described in [RFC 2631] MUST be used to prevent small subgroup attacks.

4.4.3.3.2 Integrated Mapping

ECDH

The function Map:G → Ĝ is defined as Ĝ = fG(Rp(s,t)), where Rp() is a pseudo-random function that maps octet strings to elements of GF(p) and fG() is a function that maps elements of GF(p) to <G>. The random nonce t SHALL be chosen randomly by the inspection system and sent to the eMRTD chip. The pseudo-random function Rp()is described below. The function fG() is defined in [BCIMRT2010]. An informative description is given in Appendix B.

DH

The function Map:g → ĝ is defined as ĝ = fg(Rp(s,t)), where Rp() is a pseudo-random function that maps octet strings to elements of GF(p) and fg() is a function that maps elements of GF(p) to <g>. The random nonce t SHALL be chosen randomly by the inspection system and sent to the eMRTD chip. The pseudo-random function Rp() is described below. The function fg() is defined as fg(x)=xa mod p, and a = (p-1)/q is the cofactor. Implementations MUST check that ĝ ≠ 1.

Pseudo-random Number Mapping

The function Rp(s,t) is a function that maps octet strings s (of bit length l) and t (of bit length k) to an element int(x1||x2||...||xn) mod p of GF(p). The function Rp(s,t) is specified below in Figure 2.

The construction is based on the respective block cipher E() in CBC mode according to [ISO/IEC 10116] with IV=0, where k is the key size (in bits) of E(). Where required, the output ki MUST be truncated to key size k. The value n SHALL be selected as smallest number, such that n*l ≥ log2 p + 64.

Note.— The truncation is only necessary for AES-192: Use octets 1 to 24 of ki; additional octets are not used. In case of DES, k is considered to be equal to 128 bits, and the output of R(s,t) shall be 128 bits.

##### 4.4.3.5 Encrypted Chip Authentication Data

The eMRTD chip MUST provide static key pair(s) SKIC, PKIC as described in Section 6.2. Encrypted Chip Authentication Data is REQUIRED for PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping.

4.4.3.5.1 Generation by the eMRTD chip

The Chip Authentication Data SHALL be computed as CAIC = (SKIC)-1 * SKMap,IC mod p, where SKIC is the static private key of the chip, SKMap, IC is the ephemeral private key used by the chip to compute H in the mapping phase of PACE (cf. Section 4.4.3.3.1) and p is the order of the used cryptographic group. The Chip Authentication Data SHALL be encrypted using the key KSEnc derived from the key agreement as AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) to yield the Encrypted Chip Authentication Data.

Note.— (SKIC)-1 can be precomputed during personalization of the eMRTD chip and securely stored in the chip, avoiding the modular inversion during run-time.

4.4.3.5.2 Verification by the terminal

The terminal SHALL decrypt AIC to recover CAIC and verify PKMap,IC = KA(CAIC, PKIC, DIC), where PKIC is the static public key of the eMRTD chip.

4.4.3.5.3 Padding

The data to be encrypted SHALL be padded according to [ISO/IEC 9797-1] “Padding Method 2”.

##### 4.4.4.3 Command Chaining

Command chaining MUST be used for the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command to link the sequence of commands to the execution of the protocol. Command chaining MUST NOT be used for other purposes unless clearly indicated by the chip. For details on command chaining see [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

#### 4.4.5 Exchanged Data

The protocol specific data objects SHALL be exchanged in a chain of GENERAL AUTHENTICATE commands, with protocol specific command and response data encapsulated in a Dynamic Authentication data object (see Section 4.4.4.2) with context specific tags as shown in Table 4:

4.4.5.2.2 Integrated Mapping

The nonce t SHALL be encoded as octet string.

Note.— The context specific data object 0x82 SHALL be empty for the Integrated Mapping.

4.4.5.2.3 Chip Authentication Mapping

The encoding of the mapping data is identical to the Generic Mapping (cf. Section 4.4.5.2.1).

##### 4.4.5.3 Public Keys

The public keys SHALL be encoded as described in Section 9.4.5.

##### 4.4.5.4 Authentication Token

The authentication token (cf. Section 4.4.3.4) SHALL be encoded as octet string.

##### 4.4.5.5 Certification Authority Reference

The Certification Authority Reference (CAR) data objects SHALL be encoded as specified in Doc 9303-12.

##### 4.4.5.6 Encrypted Chip Authentication Data

The Chip Authentication Data SHALL be encoded as octet string using the function FE2OS() specified in [TR-03111] before encryption. Note that FE2OS() requires the encoding with the same number of octets as the prime order of the group, i.e. possibly including leading 0x00's. The Encrypted Chip Authentication Data SHALL be encoded as octet string.

<!-- page 33 -->

## 5. AUTHENTICATION OF DATA

In addition to the LDS Data Groups, the contactless IC also contains a Document Security Object (SOD). This object is digitally signed by the issuing State or organization and contains hash representations of the LDS contents (see Doc 9303-10).

An inspection system, containing the Document Signer Public Key of each State, or having read the Document Signer Certificate (CDS) from the eMRTD, will be able to verify the Document Security Object (SOD). In this way, through the contents of the Document Security Object (SOD), the contents of the LDS are authenticated.

This verification mechanism does not require processing capabilities of the contactless IC in the eMRTD. Therefore it is called “Passive Authentication” of the contactless IC’s contents.

Passive Authentication proves that the contents of the Document Security Object (SOD) and LDS are authentic and not changed. It does not prevent exact copying of the contactless IC’s content or chip substitution.

Therefore Passive Authentication SHOULD be supported by an additional physical inspection of the eMRTD.

### 5.1 Passive Authentication

#### 5.1.1 Inspection Process

The inspection system performs the following steps:

1. The inspection system SHALL read the Document Security Object (SOD) (which MUST contain the Document Signer Certificate (CDS), see also Doc 9303-10) from the contactless IC.

2. The inspection system SHALL build and validate a certification path from a Trust Anchor to the Document Signer Certificate used to sign the Document Security Object (SOD) according to Doc 9303-12.

3. The inspection system SHALL use the verified Document Signer Public Key to verify the signature of the Document Security Object (SOD).

4. The inspection system MAY read relevant Data Groups from the contactless IC.

5. The inspection system SHALL ensure that the contents of the Data Group are authentic and unchanged by hashing the contents and comparing the result with the corresponding hash value in the Document Security Object (SOD).

The following additional checks are considered Best Practice:

1. The inspection system or the inspection officer SHOULD check the presence of a DocumentTypeExtension in the Document Signer Certificate.

* If yes, the inspection system SHOULD check the consistency of the DocumentTypeExtension, the Document Type from Data Group 1 and the Document Type from the visual MRZ (see Docs 9303-12, 9303-10 and 9303-3, respectively).
* If no, the inspection system SHOULD check that the KeyUsage of the Document Signer Certificate is set to digitalSignature and that the Document Signer Certificate contains no ExtendedKeyUsage-Extension (see Doc 9303-12).

<!-- page 34 -->

2. The inspection system or the inspection officer SHOULD check the consistency of the country codes from:

* the Subject-field and, if present, the SubjectAltName of the Document Signer Certificate;
* the Subject-field and, if present, the SubjectAltName of the Trust Anchor (CSCA certificate);
* the Data Group 1 as read from the contactless IC; and
* the visual MRZ.

Additionally, the inspection system or the inspection officer MAY compare the contents of Data Group 1 to the visual MRZ (see Docs 9303-12, 9303-10 and 9303-3, respectively).

3. The inspection system SHOULD verify that the Issuing Date of the eMRTD is included in the Private Key Usage Period contained in the Document Signer Certificate (see Doc 9303-12).

The biometric information can now be used to perform the biometrics verification with the person who offers the eMRTD.

#### 5.1.2 Additional Inspection Process for LDS2 Applications

Data written after issuance of the eMRTD are not protected by the Document Security Object, which is signed by the issuer of the document. To verify the authenticity of data written after issuance, the following steps MUST be performed by the inspection system for each written data object:

1. The inspection system SHALL build and validate a certification path from a Trust Anchor to the Signer Certificate used to sign the data object according to Doc 9303-12. The inspection system MAY use both certificates known beforehand and certificates retrieved from the chip to build the path (see Doc 9303-10).

2. The inspection system SHALL use the verified Signer Public Key to verify the signature of the data object.

Note.— This procedure can be skipped for data objects whose authenticity is not deemed relevant for the inspection process by the receiving State or organization.

## 6. AUTHENTICATION OF THE CONTACTLESS IC

An issuing State or organization MAY choose to protect its eMRTDs against chip substitution.

The following mechanisms to verify the authenticity of the chip are available.

1. Active Authentication, as defined in Section 6.1. Support of Active Authentication is indicated by the presence of EF.DG15. If available, the terminal MAY read and verify EF.DG15 and perform Active Authentication.

2. Chip Authentication, as defined in Section 6.2. Support of Chip Authentication is indicated by the presence

<!-- page 35 -->

of corresponding SecurityInfos in EF.DG14/EF.CardSecurity. If available, the terminal MAY read and verify EF.DG14/EF.CardSecurity and perform Chip Authentication.

3. PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) as defined in Section 4.4. Support is indicated by the presence of a corresponding PACEInfo structure in EF.CardAccess. If PACE-CAM was performed successfully in the chip access procedure, the terminal MAY perform the following to authenticate the chip:

* read and verify EF.CardSecurity
* use the Public Key from EF.CardSecurity together with the Mapping Data and the Chip Authentication Data received as part of PACE-CAM to authenticate the chip (Section 4.4.3.5.2).

### 6.1 Active Authentication

Active Authentication authenticates the contactless IC by signing a challenge sent by the IFD (inspection system) with a private key known only to the IC.

For this purpose the contactless IC contains its own Active Authentication Key pair (KPrAA and KPuAA). A hash representation of Data Group 15 (Public Key (KPuAA) info) is stored in the Document Security Object (SOD) and therefore authenticated by the issuer’s digital signature. The corresponding Private Key (KPrAA) is stored in the contactless IC’s secure memory.

By authenticating the visual MRZ (through the hashed MRZ in the Document Security Object (SOD)) in combination with the challenge response, using the eMRTD’s Active Authentication Key Pair (KPrAA and KPuAA), the inspection system verifies that the Document Security Object (SOD) has been read from the genuine contactless IC, stored in the genuine eMRTD.

Active Authentication requires processing capabilities of the eMRTD’s contactless IC.

#### 6.1.1 Protocol Specification

Active Authentication is performed using the [ISO/IEC 7816-4] INTERNAL AUTHENTICATE command.

If Active Authentication is performed after Secure Messaging was established, all commands and responses MUST be transmitted as Secure Messaging APDUs according to Section 9.8.

In more detail, IFD (inspection system) and IC (eMRTD’s contactless IC) perform the following steps:

1. The IFD generates a nonce RND.IFD and sends it to the IC using the INTERNAL AUTHENTICATE command.

2. The IC performs the following operations:

a) generate the message M;

b) calculate h(M);

compute the signature σ and send the response to the IFD.

<!-- page 36 -->

3. The IFD verifies the response on the sent INTERNAL AUTHENTICATE command and checks if the IC returned the correct value.

#### 6.1.2 Cryptographic Specifications

##### 6.1.2.1 Nonce

The input is a nonce (RND.IFD) that MUST be 8 bytes.

Note.— Nonces MUST NOT be reused, e.g. the nonce used for BAC/PACE MUST NOT be reused for Active Authentication.

##### 6.1.2.2 RSA

The IC SHALL compute a signature, when an integer factorization based mechanism is used, according to [ISO/IEC 9796-2] Digital Signature scheme 1.

In the following, k denotes the length in bits of the key for signature generation and Lh the length in bits of the output of the hash function H used during signature generation. The trailer field option 1 MUST be used (and t set to 1) if SHA-1 is used during signature generation, trailer field option 2 MUST be used otherwise (and t set to 2).

The following values for the trailer field SHALL be used for option 2:

| Hash function | SHA-224 | SHA-256 | SHA-384 | SHA-512 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Trailer field | 0x38CC | 0x34CC | 0x36CC | 0x35CC |

For interoperability reasons, only SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 are supported as hash functions for Active Authentication with RSA.

The message M to be signed SHALL be the concatenation of M1 and M2, where M1 MUST be a nonce of length c - 4 bits (RND.IC) generated by the eMRTD, where c (the capacity of the signature in bits) is given by c = k - Lh - (8 bits x t) – 4 bits, and M2 is RND.IFD generated by the Inspection System.

The result of the signature computation MUST be a signature σ without the non-recoverable message part M2.

eMRTDs SHOULD implement the signature generation scheme specified in [ISO/IEC 9796-2] paragraph B.6 and SHOULD NOT make use of the signature generation scheme specified in [ISO/IEC 9796-2] paragraph B.4. eMRTDs SHALL NOT implement other signature generation schemes.

Inspection systems SHALL implement the signature generation scheme specified in [ISO/IEC 9796-2] paragraph B.6 and SHOULD implement the signature generation scheme specified in [ISO/IEC 9796-2] paragraph B.4.

<!-- page 37 -->

##### 6.1.2.3 ECDSA

For ECDSA, the plain signature format according to [TR-03111] SHALL be used. Only prime curves with uncompressed points SHALL be used. A hash algorithm, whose output length is of the same length or shorter than the length of the ECDSA key in use, SHALL be used. Only SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512 are supported as hash functions. RIPEMD-160 and SHA-1 SHALL NOT be used.

The message M to be signed is the nonce RND.IFD provided by the Inspection System.

#### 6.1.3 Application Protocol Data Units

Active Authentication is performed by a single invocation of the INTERNAL AUTHENTICATE command as specified in [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

| Command |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CLA |  | Context specific |  |
| INS | 0x88 | INTERNAL AUTHENTICATE |  |
| P1/P2 | 0x0000 | — |  |
| Data |  | RND.IFD | REQUIRED |
| Response |  |  |  |
| Data |  | Signature σ generated by the IC | REQUIRED |
| Status<br>Bytes | 0x9000 | Normal processing<br>The protocol has been performed successfully. |  |
|  | Other | Operating system dependent error<br>The protocol failed. |  |

#### 6.1.4 Active Authentication Keys

The Active Authentication Key Pairs (KPrAA and KPuAA) SHALL be generated in a secure way.

Both the Active Authentication Public Key (KPuAA) and the Active Authentication Private Key (KPrAA) are stored in the eMRTD’s contactless IC. After that, no Key Management is applicable for these keys.

Note.— It should be noted that when using key lengths exceeding 1 848 bits (if Secure Messaging with 3DES is used) / 1 792 bits (if Secure Messaging with AES is used) in Active Authentication with Secure Messaging, Extended Length APDUs MUST be supported by the eMRTD chip and the Inspection System.

Issuing States or organizations SHALL choose appropriate key lengths offering protection against attacks for the life time of the eMRTD. Suitable cryptographic catalogues SHOULD be taken into account.

<!-- page 38 -->

#### 6.1.5 Active Authentication Public Key Info

The Active Authentication Public Key is stored in the LDS Data Group 15. The format of the structure (SubjectPublicKeyInfo) is specified in [RFC 5280], see Section 9.1. All security objects MUST be produced in Distinguished Encoding Rule (DER) format to preserve the integrity of the signatures within them.

ActiveAuthenticationPublicKeyInfo ::= SubjectPublicKeyInfo

#### 6.1.6 Inspection Process

When an eMRTD with Data Group 15 is offered to the inspection system, the Active Authentication mechanism MAY be performed to ensure that the data are read from the genuine contactless IC and that the contactless IC and physical document belong to each other.

The inspection system and the contactless IC perform the following steps:

1. The entire MRZ is read visually from the eMRTD (if not already read as part of the Chip Access Procedure, i.e. PACE or BAC) and compared with the MRZ value in Data Group 1. Since the authenticity and integrity of Data Group 1 have been checked through Passive Authentication, similarity ensures that the visual MRZ is authentic and unchanged.

2. Passive Authentication has also proven the authenticity and integrity of Data Group 15. This ensures that the Active Authentication Public Key (KPuAA) is authentic and unchanged.

3. To ensure that the Document Security Object (SOD) is not a copy, the inspection system uses the eMRTD’s Active Authentication Key pair (KPrAA and KPuAA) in a challenge-response protocol with the eMRTD’s contactless IC as described above.

After a successful challenge-response protocol, it is proven that the Document Security Object (SOD) belongs to the physical document, the contactless IC is genuine and contactless IC and physical document belong to each other.

### 6.2 Chip Authentication

The Chip Authentication Protocol is an ephemeral-static Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol that provides secure communication and unilateral authentication of the eMRTD chip.

The main differences to Active Authentication are:

* Challenge Semantics are prevented because the transcripts produced by this protocol are non-transferable.
* Besides authentication of the eMRTD chip this protocol also provides strong session keys.

Details on Challenge Semantics are described in Appendix C.

The static Chip Authentication Key Pair(s) MUST be stored on the eMRTD chip.

* The private key SHALL be stored securely in the eMRTD chip’s memory.
* The public key SHALL be provided as SubjectPublicKeyInfo in the ChipAuthenticationPublicKeyInfo structure (see Section 9.2.6).

<!-- page 39 -->

The protocol provides implicit authentication of both the eMRTD chip itself and the stored data by performing Secure Messaging using the new session keys.

If the IC supports Chip Authentication, the IC MAY support Chip Authentication in the Master File and/or MAY support Chip Authentication in the eMRTD Application. If Chip Authentication is used in conjunction with accessing data groups in LDS2 Applications, the IC MUST support Chip Authentication in the Master File.

Note.— If compatibility with European Union Extended Access Control [TR-03110] is required, the IC MUST support Chip Authentication in the eMRTD Application.

#### 6.2.1 Protocol Specification

The following steps are performed by the terminal and the eMRTD chip.

1. The eMRTD chip sends its static Diffie-Hellman public key PKIC, and the domain parameters DIC to the terminal.

2. The terminal generates an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key pair (SKDH,IFD, PKDH,IFD, DIC) and sends the ephemeral public key PKDH,IFD to the eMRTD chip.

3. Both the eMRTD chip and the terminal compute the following:

a) The shared secret K = KA(SKIC, PKDH,IFD, DIC) = KA(SKDH,IFD, PKIC, DIC)

b) The session keys KSMAC = KDFMAC(K) and KSEnc = KDFEnc(K) derived from K for Secure Messaging.

A simplified version is shown in Figure 3:

| IC (chip) |  | IFD (Inspection system) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Static key pair (SK , PK , D )<br>IC IC IC<br>— PK , D →<br>IC IC<br>Choose random ephemeral key pair<br>(SK , PK , D )<br>DH,IFD DH,IFD IC<br>← PK —<br>DH,IFD<br>K = KA(SK , PK , D ) K = KA(SK , PK , D )<br>IC DH,IFD IC DH,IFD IC IC |  |  |

Figure 3.    Chip Authentication

To verify the authenticity of the PKIC the terminal SHALL perform Passive Authentication.

#### 6.2.2 Security Status

If Chip Authentication was successfully performed, Secure Messaging is restarted using the derived session keys KSMAC and KSEnc. Otherwise, Secure Messaging is continued using the previously established session keys (PACE or Basic Access Control).

Note.— Passive Authentication MUST be performed in combination with Chip Authentication. Only after a successful validation of the respective Security Object may the eMRTD chip be considered genuine.

<!-- page 40 -->

#### 6.2.3 Cryptographic Specifications

Particular algorithms are selected by the issuing State or organization. The inspection system MUST support all combinations described in the following subsections. The eMRTD chip MAY support more than one combination of algorithms.

##### 6.2.3.1 Chip Authentication with DH

For Chip Authentication with DH the respective algorithms and formats from Section 9.6 and Table 5 MUST be used.

Table 5.    Object Identifiers for Chip Authentication with DH

| OID | Sym. Cipher | Key Length | Secure Messaging |

Note.— 3DES may become deprecated in the future.

##### 6.2.3.2 Chip Authentication with ECDH

For Chip Authentication with ECDH the respective algorithms and formats from Section 9.6 and Table 6 MUST be used.

| id-CA-ECDH-AES-CBC-CMAC-256 | AES | 256 | CBC / CMAC |

Note.— 3DES may become deprecated in the future.

<!-- page 41 -->

#### 6.2.4 Applications Protocol Data Units

Depending on the symmetric algorithm to be used, two implementations of Chip Authentication are available.

* If Chip Authentication with 3DES Secure Messaging is supported, the following command SHALL be implemented:

1. MSE:Set KAT

* If Chip Authentication with AES Secure Messaging is supported, the following sequence of commands SHALL be implemented:

1. MSE:Set AT

2. GENERAL AUTHENTICATE

* If both the MSE:Set KAT command and the MSE:Set AT command sequence are implemented, the MSE:Set AT command sequence MAY additionally be used to perform Chip Authentication with 3DES Secure Messaging.

##### 6.2.4.1 Implementation using MSE:Set KAT

Note.— MSE:Set KAT may only be used for id-CA-DH-3DES-CBC-CBC and id-CA-ECDH-3DES-CBC-CBC, i.e. Secure Messaging is restricted to 3DES.

##### 6.2.4.2 Implementation using MSE:Set AT and GENERAL AUTHENTICATE

1. MSE:Set AT: The command MSE:Set AT is used to select and initialize the protocol. The use of MSE:Set AT for Chip Authentication is indicated by a Chip Authentication Object Identifier (see Sections 6.2.3 and 9.2.7) contained as cryptographic mechanism reference with tag 0x80, see table below.

Note.— The public keys for Chip Authentication supported by the chip are made available in the Security Object (see Section 9.2.11). If more than one public key is supported, the terminal MUST select the corresponding private key of the chip to be used within MSE:Set AT.

##### 6.2.4.3 Ephemeral Public Key

The ephemeral public keys (cf. Section 9.4.5) SHALL be encoded as elliptic curve point (ECDH) or unsigned integer (DH).

<!-- page 44 -->

## 7. ADDITIONAL ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS

The personal data stored in the contactless IC as defined to be the mandatory minimum for global interoperability are the MRZ and the digitally stored image of the bearer’s face. Both items can also be seen (read) visually after the eMRTD has been opened and offered for inspection.

Besides the digitally stored image of the face as the primary biometric for global interoperability, ICAO has endorsed the use of digitally stored images of fingers and/or irises in addition to the face. For national or bilateral use, States MAY choose to store templates and/or MAY choose to limit access or encrypt this data, as to be decided by States themselves.

Access to this more sensitive personal data SHOULD be more restricted. This can be accomplished in two ways: extended access control or data encryption. Section 7.1 specifies Terminal Authentication as an interoperable mechanism for extended access control. If no interoperability is required, other mechanisms can be used.

### 7.1 Terminal Authentication

The Terminal Authentication mechanism is CONDITIONAL. Implementation is REQUIRED for LDS2 applications. Terminal Authentication MAY be used to protect secondary biometrics in the eMRTD Application.

The Terminal Authentication Protocol is a two move challenge-response protocol that provides explicit unilateral authentication of the terminal. The protocol is based on Extended Access Control as specified in [TR-03110]. If this protocol is supported by the IC, it MUST support Chip Authentication or PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping.

This protocol enables the IC to verify that the terminal is entitled to access sensitive data. As the terminal may access sensitive data afterwards, all further communication MUST be protected appropriately. Terminal Authentication therefore also authenticates an ephemeral public key chosen by the terminal that was used to set up Secure Messaging with Chip Authentication or PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping. The IC MUST bind the terminal’s access rights to Secure Messaging established by the authenticated ephemeral public key of the terminal.

The IC MAY support Terminal Authentication in the Master File and/or the eMRTD Application. If Terminal Authentication is used to protect data groups in other applications than the eMRTD Application, the IC MUST support Terminal Authentication in the Master File.

Note.— If compatibility with European Union Extended Access Control [TR-03110] is required, the IC MUST support Terminal Authentication in the eMRTD Application.

#### 7.1.2 Protocol Specification

The following steps are performed by the terminal and the IC:

1. The terminal sends a certificate chain to the IC. The chain starts with a certificate verifiable with the CVCA public key stored on the chip and ends with the Terminal Certificate.

2. The IC verifies the certificates and extracts the terminal’s public key PKIFD.

3. The IC randomly chooses a challenge rIC and sends it to the terminal.

4. The terminal responds with the signature sIFD = Sign(SKIFD, IDIC||rIC||Comp(PKDH,IFD)).

<!-- page 45 -->

5. The IC checks that Verify(PKIFD , sIFD, IDIC ||rIC||Comp(PKDH,IFD)) = true.

Note.— The key PKDH,IFD is generated during Chip Authentication or PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping. If more than one key is generated (e.g. Chip Authentication is performed after PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping), the newest key MUST be used.

In this protocol, IDIC is an identifier of the IC:

* If BAC is used, IDIC is the eMRTD’s Document Number as contained in the MRZ including the check digit.
* If PACE is used, IDIC is computed using the IC’s ephemeral PACE public key, i.e. IDIC = Comp(PKDH,IC).

Note.— A successful execution of the PACE protocol is REQUIRED before Terminal Authentication can be performed in the MF.

A simplified version is shown below:

| IC (chip) |  | IFD (inspection system) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Choose r randomly<br>IC<br>— r →<br>IC<br>s = Sign(SK ,ID \|\|r \|\|Comp(PK ))<br>IFD IFD IC IC DH,IFD<br>← s —-<br>IFD<br>Verify(PK , s , ID \|\|r \|\|Comp(PK )) = true<br>IFD IFD IC IC DH,IFD |  |  |

Figure 4.    Terminal Authentication

#### 7.1.3 Security Status

If Terminal Authentication was successfully performed, the IC SHALL grant access to stored sensitive data according to the effective authorization of the authenticated terminal. If the effective authorization does not grant access rights to any data in a LDS2 Application, selecting this application MUST be rejected by the IC.

The IC SHALL however restrict the terminal’s access rights to Secure Messaging established by the authenticated ephemeral public key, i.e. the ephemeral public key provided by the terminal as part of Chip Authentication or PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping. The IC MUST NOT accept more than one execution of Terminal Authentication within the same session (cf. Section 9.8.1 and Section 9.8.3 on the definition of “session”).

Note 1.— Access rights are valid as long as the Secure Messaging established by the authenticated ephemeral public keys is active, therefore the security status is not affected by selecting or deselecting applications.

Note 2.— Secure Messaging is not affected by Terminal Authentication. The eMRTD chip SHALL retain Secure Messaging even if Terminal Authentication fails (unless a Secure Messaging error occurs).

<!-- page 46 -->

#### 7.1.4 Cryptographic Specifications

##### 7.1.4.1 Terminal Authentication with RSA

For Terminal Authentication with RSA the following algorithms and formats MUST be used.

##### 7.1.4.1.1 Signature Algorithm

RSA [RFC-3447], [PKCS#1] as specified in Table 7 SHALL be used.

Table 7.    Object Identifiers for Terminal Authentication with RSA

| OID | Signature | Hash | Parameters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id-TA-RSA-PSS-SHA-256 | RSASSA-PSS | SHA-256 | default |
| id-TA-RSA-PSS-SHA-512 | RSASSA-PSS | SHA-512 | default |

The default parameters to be used with RSA-PSS are defined as follows:

* Hash Algorithm: The hash algorithm is selected according to Table 7.
* Mask Generation Algorithm: MGF1 [RFC-3447], [PKCS#1] using the selected hash algorithm.
* Salt Length: Octet length of the output of the selected hash algorithm.
* Trailer Field: 0xBC

##### 7.1.4.1.2 Public Key Format

The TLV-Format [ISO/IEC 7816-8] as described in Doc 9303-12 SHALL be used.

* The object identifier SHALL be taken from Table 7.
* The bit length of the modulus SHALL be 2 048, or 3 072.
* The bit length of the exponent SHALL be at most 32.

##### 7.1.4.1.3 Public Key Compression

The terminal’s compressed ephemeral public key Comp(PKDH,IFD) is defined as the SHA-1 hash of the DH public value, i.e. an octet string of fixed length 20.

##### 7.1.4.2 Terminal Authentication with ECDSA

For Terminal Authentication with ECDSA the following algorithms and formats MUST be used.

##### 7.1.4.2.1 Signature Algorithm

ECDSA with plain signature format [TR-03111] as specified in Table 8 SHALL be used.

<!-- page 47 -->

Table 8.     Object Identifiers for Terminal Authentication with ECDSA

| OID | Signature | Hash |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-224 | ECDSA | SHA-224 |
| id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-256 | ECDSA | SHA-256 |
| id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-384 | ECDSA | SHA-384 |
| id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-512 | ECDSA | SHA-512 |

##### 7.1.4.2.2 Public Key Format

The TLV-Format [ISO/IEC 7816-8] as described in Doc 9303-12 SHALL be used.

* The object identifier SHALL be taken from Table 8.
* The bit length of the curve SHALL be 224, 256, 320, 384 or 512.
* Domain Parameters SHALL be compliant to [TR-03111].

##### 7.1.4.2.3 Public Key Compression

The terminal’s compressed ephemeral public key Comp(PKDH,IFD) is defined as the x-coordinate of the ECDH public point, i.e. an octet string of fixed length ⌈log256p⌉.

##### 7.1.4.3 Certificate Validation

To validate a Terminal Certificate, the IC MUST be provided with a certificate chain starting at a trust-point stored on the IC. Those trust-points are more or less recent public keys of the IC’s CVCA.

##### 7.1.4.3.1 Initial State of the IC’s Trust-point(s)

The initial trust-point(s) SHALL be stored securely in the IC's memory in the production or (pre-)personalization phase.

The (pre-)personalization agent SHALL:

* set the current date of the IC to the date of the (pre-)personalization; and
* personalize the CVCA key with the most recent effective date as trust-point.

The (pre-)personalization agent MAY additionally personalize the previous CVCA key as trust-point.

##### 7.1.4.3.2 Link Certificates

As the key pair used by the CVCA changes over time, CVCA Link Certificates have to be produced. CVCA Link Certificates MUST be signed with the previous CVCA key, i.e. the CVCA key with the most recent effective date. The IC is REQUIRED to internally update its trust-point(s) according to received valid link certificates.

The IC MUST be able to store up to two trust-points.

<!-- page 48 -->

Note.— Due to the scheduling of CVCA Link Certificates (see Doc 9303-12), at most two trust-points need to be stored on the IC.

##### 7.1.4.3.3 Current Date

The IC MUST accept expired CVCA Link Certificates but it MUST NOT accept expired DV and Terminal Certificates. To determine whether a certificate is expired, the IC SHALL use its current date.

Current Date: If the IC has no internal clock, the current date of the IC SHALL be approximated as described in the following. The date is autonomously approximated by the IC using the most recent certificate effective date contained in a valid CVCA Link Certificate, a DV Certificate or an Accurate Terminal Certificate.

Accurate Terminal Certificate: A Terminal Certificate is accurate if the issuing Document Verifier (DV) is trusted by the IC to produce Terminal Certificates with the correct certificate effective date. CVCA Link Certificates, DV Certificates and Terminal Certificates issued by a domestic DV SHALL be considered accurate by the IC. Other certificates MUST NOT be considered accurate.

A terminal MAY send CVCA Link Certificates, DV Certificates, and Terminal Certificates to an IC to update the current date and the trust-point stored on the IC even if the terminal does not intend to or is not able to continue with Terminal Authentication.

Note.— The IC only verifies that a certificate is apparently recent (i.e. with respect to the approximated current date), unless the IC contains an internal clock.

##### 7.1.4.3.4 General Validation Procedure

The certificate validation procedure consists of three steps:

1. Certificate Verification: The signature MUST be valid and unless the certificate is a CVCA Link Certificate, the certificate MUST NOT be expired. If the verification fails, the procedure SHALL be aborted.

Note.— The case of an expired CVCA Link Certificate can only occur if the IC has a source of time beyond the approximated current date described above.

2. Internal Status Update: The current date MUST be updated, the public key and the attributes (including relevant certificate extensions) MUST be imported, new trust-points MUST be enabled, expired trust-points MUST be disabled for the verification of DV Certificates.

3. Cleanup: The chip SHALL provide at most two enabled trust-points per application. If more than two trust-points for an application remain enabled after the internal status update, the trust-point with the least recent effective date SHALL be disabled.

The operation of updating the current date and the operations of enabling and disabling a trust-point MUST be implemented as an atomic operation.

Enabling a trust-point: The new trust-point SHALL be added to the list of trust-points.

Disabling a trust-point: Expired trust-points MUST NOT be used for the verification of DV Certificates. In case of ICs where the current date may be advanced beyond the expiry date of a trust-point, e.g. ICs using an internal clock, expired trust-points MUST remain usable for the verification of CVCA Link Certificates. Disabled trust-points MAY be deleted after the successful import of the successive Link Certificate.

<!-- page 49 -->

##### 7.1.4.3.5 Example Validation Procedure

The following validation procedure, provided as an example, MAY be used to validate a certificate chain. For each received certificate the IC performs the following steps:

1. The IC verifies the signature on the certificate. If the signature is incorrect, the verification fails.

2. If the certificate is not a CVCA Link Certificate, the certificate expiration date is compared to the IC’s current date. If the expiration date is before the current date, the verification fails.

3. The certificate is accepted as valid and the public key and the attributes (including relevant certificate extensions) contained in the certificate are imported.

* For CVCA, DV, and Accurate Terminal Certificates: The certificate effective date is compared to the IC’s current date. If the current date is before the effective date, the current date is updated to the effective date.
* For CVCA Link Certificates: The new CVCA public key is added to the list of trust-points stored securely in the IC’s memory. The new trust-point is then enabled.
* For DV and Terminal Certificates: The new DV or terminal public key is temporarily imported for subsequent certificate verification or Terminal Authentication, respectively.

4. Expired trust-points stored securely in the IC’s memory are disabled for the verification of DV Certificates and may be removed from the list of trust-points.

##### 7.1.4.3.6 Effective Authorization

Each certificate SHALL contain a Certificate Holder Authorization Template (see Doc 9303-12) and MAY contain Authorization Extensions (see Doc 9303-12, Section 7.2.2.6).

* The Certificate Holder Authorization Template identifies the terminal type (this specification only considers Inspection Systems, but other specifications may use different terminal types).
* The Certificate Holder Authorization Template and the Authorization Extensions determine the relative authorization of the certificate holder assigned by the issuing certificate authority.

To determine the effective authorization of a certificate holder, the IC MUST calculate a bitwise Boolean ’and’ of the relative authorization contained in the Terminal Certificate, the referenced DV Certificate, and the referenced CVCA Certificate.

The effective authorization SHALL be interpreted by the IC as follows:

* The effective role is a CVCA:
* This link certificate was issued by the national CVCA.
* The IC MUST update its internal trust-point, i.e. the public key and the effective authorization.
* The certificate issuer is a trusted source of time and the IC MUST update its current date using the Certificate Effective Date.
* The IC MUST NOT grant the CVCA access to sensitive data (i.e. the effective authorization SHOULD be ignored).
* The effective role is a DV:
* The certificate was issued by the national CVCA for an authorized DV.
* The certificate issuer is a trusted source of time and the IC MUST update its current date using the Certificate Effective Date.
* The IC MUST NOT grant a DV access to sensitive data (i.e. the effective authorization SHOULD be ignored).
* The effective role is a Terminal:
* The certificate was issued by either a domestic or a foreign DV.
* If the certificate is an accurate terminal certificate (cf. Section 7.1.4.3.3), the issuer is a trusted source of time and the IC MUST update its current date using the Certificate Effective Date.
* The IC MUST grant the authenticated terminal access to sensitive data according to the effective authorization.

<!-- page 50 -->

Note.— The Certificate Holder Authorization Template and the Authorization Extensions can contain bits not allocated to an access right (RFU bits). The IC MUST ignore these bits during evaluation of access rights.

##### 7.1.4.3.7 Public Key Import

Public keys imported by the certificate validation procedure are either permanently or temporarily stored on the IC.

The IC SHOULD reject to import a public key, if the Certificate Holder Reference is already known to the IC.

Permanent Import: Public keys contained in CVCA Link Certificates SHALL be permanently imported by the IC and MUST be stored securely in the IC’s memory. A permanently imported public key and its metadata SHALL fulfill the following conditions:

* It MAY be overwritten after expiration by a subsequent permanently imported public key.
* It either MUST be overwritten by a subsequent permanently imported public key with the same Certificate Holder Reference or the import MUST be rejected.
* It MUST NOT be overwritten by a temporarily imported public key.

Enabling and disabling a permanently imported public key MUST be an atomic operation.

Temporary Import: Public keys contained in DV and Terminal Certificates SHALL be temporarily imported by the IC. A temporarily imported public key and its metadata SHALL fulfill the following conditions:

* It SHALL NOT be selectable or usable after a power down of the IC.
* It MUST remain usable until the subsequent cryptographic operation is successfully completed (i.e. PSO:Verify Certificate or External Authenticate).
* It MAY be overwritten by a subsequent temporarily imported public key.

<!-- page 51 -->

A terminal MUST NOT make use of any temporarily imported public key but the most recently imported.

Imported Metadata: For each permanently or temporarily imported public key, the following additional data contained in the certificate (see Doc 9303-12) MUST be stored:

* Certificate Holder Reference
* Certificate Holder Authorization (effective role and effective authorization)
* Certificate Effective Date
* Certificate Expiration Date
* Certificate Extensions (where applicable)

The calculation of the effective role (CVCA, DV, or Terminal) and the effective authorization of the certificate holder is described in Section 7.1.4.3.6.

Note.— The format of the stored data is dependent on the operating system and out of the scope of this specification.

#### 7.1.5 Application Protocol Data Units

The following sequence of commands SHALL be used with secure messaging to implement Terminal Authentication:

* MSE:Set DST
* PSO:Verify Certificate
* MSE:Set AT
* Get Challenge
* External Authenticate

Steps 1 and 2 are repeated for every CV certificate to be verified (CVCA Link Certificates, DV Certificate, Terminal Certificate).

### 7.2 Encryption of Additional Biometrics

Restricting access to the additional biometrics MAY also be done by encrypting them. To be able to decrypt the encrypted data, the inspection system MUST be provided with a decryption key. Defining the encryption/decryption algorithm and the keys to be used is up to the implementing State and is outside the scope of this document.

The implementation of the protection of the additional biometrics depends on the State’s internal specifications or the bilaterally agreed specifications between States sharing this information.

## 8. INSPECTION SYSTEM

In order to support the required functionality and the defined options that can be implemented on eMRTDs that will be offered, the inspection system will have to meet certain pre-conditions.

### 8.1 Basic Access Control

Inspection systems supporting Basic Access Control MUST meet the following pre-conditions:

1. The inspection system is equipped with means to acquire the MRZ from the physical document to derive the Document Basic Access Keys (KEnc and KMAC) from the eMRTD.

<!-- page 55 -->

2. The inspection system’s software supports the protocol described in Section 4.3, in the case that an eMRTD with Basic Access Control is offered to the system, including the encryption of the communication channel with Secure Messaging.

### 8.2 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment

Inspection systems supporting PACE MUST meet the following pre-conditions:

1. The inspection system is equipped with means to acquire the MRZ and/or the CAN from the physical document.

2. The inspection system’s software supports the protocol described in Section 4.4, in the case that an eMRTD with PACE is offered to the system, including the encryption of the communication channel with Secure Messaging.

### 8.3 Passive Authentication

To be able to perform a passive authentication of the data stored in the eMRTDs contactless IC, the inspection system needs to have knowledge of key information of the issuing States or organizations:

1. For each issuing State or organization, the Country Signing CA Certificate or the relevant information extracted from the certificate SHALL be securely stored in the inspection system.

2. Alternatively, for each issuing State or organization, the Document Signer Certificates (CDS) or the relevant information extracted from the certificates SHALL be securely stored in the inspection system.

Before using a Country Signing CA Public Key of an issuing State or organization, trust in this key MUST be established by the receiving State or organization.

Before using a Document Signer Certificate (CDS) for verification of a SOD, the inspection system SHALL verify its digital signature, using the Country Signing CA Public Key.

Additionally, inspection systems SHALL have access to verified revocation information.

### 8.4 Active Authentication

Support of Active Authentication by inspection systems is OPTIONAL.

If the inspection system supports Active Authentication, it is REQUIRED that the inspection system have the ability to read the visual MRZ.

If the inspection system supports Active Authentication, the inspection system’s software SHALL support the Active Authentication protocol described in Section 6.1.

<!-- page 56 -->

### 8.5 Chip Authentication

Support of Chip Authentication by inspection systems is OPTIONAL.

If the inspection system supports Chip Authentication, it is REQUIRED that the inspection system have the ability to read the visual MRZ.

If the inspection system supports Chip Authentication, the inspection system’s software SHALL support the Chip Authentication protocol described in Section 6.2.

If the inspection system supports Chip Authentication, and the eMRTD indicates support for Chip Authentication with 3DES and AES Secure Messaging, the inspection system SHOULD perform Chip Authentication with AES Secure Messaging.

Note 1.— eMRTDs supporting Chip Authentication with 3DES Secure Messaging have been issued that implement the MSE:Set AT and General Authenticate command, but not the MSE:Set KAT command. These eMRTDs are not Doc 9303 compliant and if the inspection system performs Chip Authentication with 3DES Secure Messaging, the execution of the MSE:Set KAT command fails. In order to support such non-compliant eMRTDs, the inspection system:

a) should perform Chip Authentication with AES Secure Messaging if supported by the eMRTD; or

b) may perform Chip Authentication with 3DES Secure Messaging again using the MSE:Set AT command sequence within the same session.

Note 2.— eMRTDs supporting Chip Authentication with DH have been issued that provide a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure within the ChipAuthenticationPublicKeyInfo Security Object that encodes the Chip Authentication Public Key according to X9.42 instead of PKCS#3. These eMRTDs are not Doc 9303 compliant and if the inspection system performs Chip Authentication, decoding of the public key fails. In order to support such non-compliant eMRTDs, the inspection system should implement X9.42 [X9.42] support for the encoding of Chip Authentication Public Keys.

### 8.6 Terminal Authentication

Support of Terminal Authentication by inspection systems is OPTIONAL.

If the inspection system supports Terminal Authentication, it is REQUIRED that the inspection system has the capability to securely store the private key of the inspection system. The inspection system MUST have access to its DV in regular intervals to renew the terminal certificate.

If the inspection system supports Terminal Authentication, the software of the inspection system SHALL support the Terminal Authentication protocol as described in Section 7.1.

### 8.7 Decryption of Additional Biometrics

The implementation of the protection of the optional additional biometrics depends on the State’s internal specifications or the bilaterally agreed specifications between States sharing this information.

<!-- page 57 -->

## 9. COMMON SPECIFICATIONS

### 9.1 ASN.1 Structures

The data structures SubjectPublicKeyInfo and AlgorithmIdentifier are defined as follows:

SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE { algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier, subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }

AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE { algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER, parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }

For PACE, details on the AlgorithmIdentifier can be found in section 9.5.

For Active Authentication the respective algorithms and formats from Section 6.1.5 MUST be used.

For Chip Authentication the respective algorithms and formats from Section 9.6 MUST be used.

### 9.2 Information on Supported Protocols and Supported Applications

The ASN.1 data structure SecurityInfos SHALL be provided by the eMRTD chip to indicate supported security protocols. The data structure is specified as follows:

SecurityInfos  ::= SET OF SecurityInfo

SecurityInfo ::= SEQUENCE { protocol  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, requiredData ANY DEFINED BY protocol, optionalData ANY DEFINED BY protocol OPTIONAL }

The elements contained in a SecurityInfo data structure have the following meaning:

* The object identifier protocol identifies the supported protocol.
* The open type requiredData contains protocol specific mandatory data.
* The open type optionalData contains protocol specific optional data.

Security Infos for PACE

To indicate support for PACE SecurityInfos may contain the following entries:

* At least one PACEInfo using a standardized domain parameter MUST be present.
* For each supported set of explicit domain parameters a PACEDomainParameterInfo MUST be present.

<!-- page 58 -->

Security Infos for Active Authentication

If ECDSA based signature algorithm is used for Active Authentication by the eMRTD chip, the SecurityInfos MUST contain the following SecurityInfo entry:

* ActiveAuthenticationInfo

Security Infos for Chip Authentication

To indicate support for Chip Authentication SecurityInfos may contain the following entries:

* At least one ChipAuthenticationInfo and the corresponding ChipAuthenticationPublicKeyInfo using explicit domain parameters MUST be present.

Security Infos for Terminal Authentication

To indicate support for Terminal Authentication SecurityInfos may contain the following entry:

* At least one TerminalAuthenticationInfo SHALL be present.

Security Infos for present Applications

Section 3.11.2 of Doc 9303-10 recommends the presence of a transparent elementary file EF.DIR to indicate supported applications. The file is mandatory if any LDS2 Application is present. Since EF.DIR is not signed and can therefore be manipulated, e.g. to hide existing applications from the IFD, a secured copy of EF.DIR is provided as SecurityInfo if any LDS2 Application is present.

Security Infos for Other Protocols

SecurityInfos MAY contain additional entries indicating support for other protocols or providing other information. The inspection system MAY discard any unknown entry.

#### 9.2.1 PACEInfo

This data structure provides detailed information on an implementation of PACE.

* The object identifier protocol SHALL identify the algorithms to be used (i.e. key agreement, symmetric cipher and MAC).
* The integer version SHALL identify the version of the protocol. Only version 2 is supported by this specification.
* The integer parameterId is used to indicate the domain parameter identifier. It MUST be used if the eMRTD chip uses standardized domain parameters (cf. Section 9.5.1), provides multiple explicit domain parameters for PACE or protocol is one of the *-CAM-* OIDs. In case of PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping, the parameterID also denotes the ID of the Chip Authentication key used, i.e. the chip MUST provide a ChipAuthenticationPublicKeyInfo with keyID equal to parameterID from this data structure.

parameterId INTEGER OPTIONAL }

#### 9.2.2 PACEDomainParameterInfo

This data structure is REQUIRED if the eMRTD chip provides explicit domain parameters for PACE and MUST be omitted otherwise.

* The object identifier protocol SHALL identify the type of the domain parameters (i.e. DH or ECDH).
* The sequence domainParameter SHALL contain the domain parameters.
* The integer parameterId MAY be used to indicate the local domain parameter identifier. It MUST be used if the eMRTD chip provides multiple explicit domain parameters for PACE.

PACEDomainParameterInfo ::= SEQUENCE {

protocol OBJECT IDENTIFIER(

id-PACE-DH-GM |

id-PACE-ECDH-GM |

id-PACE-DH-IM |

id-PACE-ECDH-IM |

id-PACE-ECDH-CAM),

domainParameter  AlgorithmIdentifier,

parameterId INTEGER OPTIONAL }

Note.— The eMRTD chip MAY support more than one set of explicit domain parameters (i.e. the chip may support different algorithms and/or key lengths). In this case the identifier MUST be disclosed in the corresponding PACEDomainParameterInfo.

<!-- page 60 -->

Domain parameters contained in PACEDomainParameterInfo are unprotected and may be insecure. Using insecure domain parameters for PACE will leak the used password. eMRTD chips MUST support at least one set of standardized domain parameters as specified in Section 9.5.1. Inspection systems MUST NOT use explicit domain parameters provided by the eMRTD chip unless those domain parameters are explicitly known to be secure by the inspection systems.

Ephemeral public keys MUST be exchanged as plain public key values. More information on the encoding can be found in Section 9.4.5.

#### 9.2.3 PACE Object Identifier

The object identifiers used for PACE are contained in the subtree of bsi-de:

bsi-de OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {

itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0)

reserved(127) etsi-identified-organization(0) 7 }

The following Object Identifier SHALL be used:

<!-- page 61 -->

#### 9.2.4 ActiveAuthenticationInfo

If ECDSA based signature algorithm is used for Active Authentication by the eMRTD chip, the SecurityInfos in LDS Data Group 14 of the eMRTD chip MUST contain following SecurityInfo entry:

ActiveAuthenticationInfo ::= SEQUENCE { protocol           OBJECT IDENTIFIER(id-icao-mrtd-security-aaProtocolObject), version            INTEGER, -- MUST be 1 signatureAlgorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER }

id-icao-mrtd-security-aaProtocolObject OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=

{ id-icao-mrtd-security 5 }

For signatureAlgorithm, the object identifiers defined in [TR-03111] SHALL be used.

Note.— The Object Identifier id-icao-mrtd-security is defined in Doc 9303-10.

#### 9.2.5 ChipAuthenticationInfo

#### 9.2.8 TerminalAuthenticationInfo

This data structure provides detailed information on an implementation of Terminal Authentication.

* The object identifier protocol SHALL identify the general Terminal Authentication Protocol as the specific protocol may change over time.
* The integer version SHALL identify the version of the protocol. Currently, version 1 is supported by this specification. Note that later versions of [TR-03110] define version 2 of this protocol, which is out of scope of this specification.

#### 9.2.10 EFDIRInfo

This data structure encapsulates a full copy of the content of the transparent elementary file EF.DIR contained in the Master File.

EFDIRInfo ::= SEQUENCE {

protocol

OBJECT IDENTIFIER(id-EFDIR),

eFDIR

OCTET STRING }

id-EFDIR OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::={ id-icao-mrtd-security 13 }

<!-- page 64 -->

#### 9.2.11 Storage on the Chip

To indicate support for the protocols and supported parameters, the eMRTD chip SHALL provide SecurityInfos in transparent elementary files (The generic structure of these files can be found in Doc 9303-10):

* The file EF.CardAccess contained in the Master File is REQUIRED if PACE is supported by the eMRTD chip and SHALL contain the relevant SecurityInfos that are required for PACE:
* PACEInfo
* PACEDomainParameterInfo
* The file EF.CardSecurity contained in the Master File is REQUIRED if
* PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping is supported by the eMRTD chip, or
* Terminal Authentication in the Master File is supported by the eMRTD chip, or
* Chip Authentication in the Master File is supported by the eMRTD

and SHALL contain the following SecurityInfos:

* ChipAuthenticationInfo as required by Chip Authentication
* ChipAuthenticationPublicKeyInfo as required for PACE-CAM/Chip Authentication
* TermninalAuthenticationInfo as required by Terminal Authentication
* EFDIRInfo if more than the eMRTD Application is present on the chip
* The SecurityInfos contained in EF.CardAccess.
* The file EF.DG14 contained in the eMRTD Application is REQUIRED if
* PACE with Generic/Integrated Mapping is supported by the eMRTD chip
* Terminal Authentication in the eMRTD Application is supported by the eMRTD chip, or
* Chip Authentication in the eMRTD Application is supported by the eMRTD chip

and SHALL contain the following SecurityInfos:

* ChipAuthenticationInfo as required for Chip Authentication
* ChipAuthenticationPublicKeyInfo as required for Chip Authentication
* TermninalAuthenticationInfo as required by Terminal Authentication
* The SecurityInfos contained in EF.CardAccess.
* The full set of SecurityInfos (including SecurityInfos contained in EF.CardAccess not specified in Doc 9303) SHALL additionally be stored in EF.DG14 of the eMRTD Application (see Doc 9303-10).

<!-- page 65 -->

The files MAY contain additional SecurityInfos out of scope of this specification.

Note.— While the authenticity of SecurityInfos stored in EF.DG14 and EF.CardSecurity is protected by Passive Authentication, the file EF.CardAccess is unprotected.

### 9.3 APDUs

#### 9.3.1 Extended Length

Depending on the size of the cryptographic objects (e.g. public keys, signatures), APDUs with extended length fields MUST be used to send this data to the eMRTD chip. For details on extended length see [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

##### 9.3.1.1 eMRTD Chips

For eMRTD chips, support of extended length is CONDITIONAL. If the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes selected by the issuing State require the use of extended length, the eMRTD chips SHALL support extended length. If the eMRTD chip supports extended length, this MUST be indicated in the ATR/ATS or in EF.ATR/INFO as specified in [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

##### 9.3.1.2 Terminals

For terminals, support of extended length is REQUIRED. A terminal SHOULD examine whether or not support for extended length is indicated in the eMRTD chip’s ATR/ATS or in EF.ATR/INFO before using this option. The terminal MUST NOT use extended length for APDUs other than the following commands unless the exact input and output buffer sizes of the eMRTD chip are explicitly stated in the ATR/ATS or in EF.ATR/INFO.

* MSE:Set KAT
* GENERAL AUTHENTICATE

#### 9.3.2 Command Chaining

Command chaining MUST be used for the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command to link the sequence of commands to the execution of the PACE protocol. Command chaining MUST NOT be used for other purposes unless clearly indicated by the chip. For details on command chaining see [ISO/IEC 7816-4].

#### 9.3.3 Data Objects

The sender of a command or response APDU MUST transmit the data objects in the data field in the order defined in the APDU descriptions.

<!-- page 66 -->

Note.— Accepting data objects in any order is not required, but enhances interoperability for some commands, e.g for MSE:Set AT/GENERAL AUTHENTICATE. However, care is to be taken in case of commands such as PSO:Verify Certifcate, where the ordering is fixed for cryptographic reasons.

### 9.4 Public Key Data Objects

A public key data object is a constructed BER TLV structure containing an object identifier and several context specific data objects nested within the cardholder public key template 0x7F49.

* The object identifier is application specific and refers not only to the public key format (i.e. the context specific data objects) but also to its usage.
* The context-specific data objects are defined by the object identifier and contain the public key value and the domain parameters.

The format of public keys data objects used in this specification is described below.

#### 9.4.1 Data Object Encoding

An unsigned integer SHALL be converted to an octet string using the binary representation of the integer in big-endian format. The minimum number of octets SHALL be used, i.e. leading octets of value 0x00 MUST NOT be used.

To encode elliptic curve points, uncompressed encoding according to [TR-03111] SHALL be used.

#### 9.4.2 RSA Public Keys

The data objects contained in an RSA public key are shown in Table 9. The order of the data objects is fixed.

Table 9.    RSA Public Key

| Data Object | Notation | Tag | Type | CV Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Object Identifier |  | 0x06 | Object Identifier | m |
| Composite modulus | n | 0x81 | Unsigned Integer | m |
| Public exponent | e | 0x82 | Unsigned Integer | m |

#### 9.4.3 Diffie Hellman Public Keys

The data objects contained in a DH public key are shown in Table 10. The order of the data objects is fixed.

<!-- page 67 -->

Table 10.    Data objects for DH public keys

| Data Object | Notation | Tag | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Object Identifier |  | 0x06 | Object Identifier |
| Prime modulus | p | 0x81 | Unsigned Integer |
| Order of the subgroup | q | 0x82 | Unsigned Integer |
| Generator | g | 0x83 | Unsigned Integer |
| Public Value | y | 0x84 | Unsigned Integer |

Note.— The encoding of key components as unsigned integer implies that each of them is encoded over the least number of bytes possible, i.e. without preceding bytes set to 0x00. In particular, DH public key may be encoded over a number of bytes smaller than the number of bytes of the prime.

#### 9.4.4 Elliptic Curve Public Keys

The data objects contained in an EC public key are shown in Table 11. The order of the data objects is fixed, CONDITIONAL domain parameters MUST be either all present, except the cofactor, or all absent as follows:

Table 11.    Data objects for ECDH public keys

| Data Object | Notation | Tag | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Object Identifier |  | 0x06 | Object Identifier |
| Prime modulus | p | 0x81 | Unsigned Integer |
| First coefficient | a | 0x82 | Unsigned Integer |
| Second coefficient | b | 0x83 | Unsigned Integer |
| Base point | G | 0x84 | Elliptic Curve Point |
| Order of the base point | r | 0x85 | Unsigned Integer |
| Public point | Y | 0x86 | Elliptic Curve Point |
| Cofactor | f | 0x87 | Unsigned Integer |

#### 9.4.5 Ephemeral Public Keys

For ephemeral public keys the format and the domain parameters are already known. Therefore, only the plain public key value, i.e. the public value y for Diffie-Hellman public keys and the public point Y for Elliptic Curve Public Keys, is used to convey the ephemeral public key in a context specific data object.

<!-- page 68 -->

Note.— The validation of ephemeral public keys is RECOMMENDED. For DH, the validation algorithm requires the eMRTD chip to have a more detailed knowledge of the domain parameters (i.e. the order of the used subgroup) than usually provided by PKCS#3.

### 9.5 Domain Parameters

With the exception of domain parameters contained in PACEInfo, all domain parameters SHALL be provided as AlgorithmIdentifier (cf. Section 9.1).

Within PACEInfo, the ID of standardized domain parameters described in Table 12 SHALL be referenced directly. Explicit domain parameters provided by PACEDomainParameterInfo MUST NOT use those IDs reserved for standardized domain parameters.

#### 9.5.1 Standardized Domain Parameters

The standardized domain parameters IDs described in the table below SHOULD be used. Explicit domain parameters MUST NOT use those IDs reserved for standardized domain parameters.

The following object identifier SHOULD be used to reference standardized domain parameters in an AlgorithmIdentifier (cf. Section 9.1):

standardizedDomainParameters OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { bsi-de algorithms(1) 2 }

Within an AlgorithmIdentifier this object identifier SHALL reference the ID of the standardized domain parameter as contained in Table 12 as INTEGER, contained as parameters in the AlgorithmIdentifier.

Table 12.    Standardized domain parameters

* This curve cannot be used with the Integrated Mapping.

#### 9.5.2 Explicit Domain Parameters

The object identifier dhpublicnumber or ecPublicKey for DH or ECDH, respectively, SHALL be used to reference explicit domain parameters in an AlgorithmIdentifier (cf. Section 9.1):

dhpublicnumber OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-x942(10046) number-type(2) 1 }

ecPublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-x962(10045) keyType(2) 1 }

In the case of elliptic curves, domain parameters MUST be described explicitly in the ECParameters structure, contained as parameters in the AlgorithmIdentifier, i.e. named curves and implicit domain parameters MUST NOT be used.

<!-- page 70 -->

### 9.6 Key Agreement Algorithms

This specification supports Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement as summarized in the following table:

Table 13.    Key agreement algorithms

| Algorithm / Format | DH | ECDH |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Key Agreement Algorithm | [PKCS#3] | ECKA [TR-03111] |
| X.509 Public Key Format | [PKCS#3] | [TR-03111] |
| TLV Public Key Format | TLV, cf. Section 9.4.3 | TLV, cf. Section 9.4.4 |
| Ephemeral Public Key Validation | [RFC 2631] | [TR-03111] |

### 9.7 Key Derivation Mechanism

#### 9.7.1 Key Derivation Function

The key derivation function KDF(K,c), is defined as follows:

Input: The following inputs are required:

* The shared secret value K (REQUIRED)
* A 32-bit, big-endian integer counter c (REQUIRED)

Output: An octet string keydata.

Actions: The following actions are performed:

* keydata = H(K || c)
* Output octet string keydata

The key derivation function KDF(K,c) requires a suitable hash function denoted by H(), i.e the bit-length of the hash function SHALL be greater or equal to the bit-length of the derived key. The hash value SHALL be interpreted as big-endian byte output.

Note.— The shared secret K is defined as an octet string. If the shared secret is generated with ECKA [TR-03111], the x-coordinate of the generated point SHALL be used.

<!-- page 71 -->

9.7.1.1    3DES

To derive 128-bit (112-bit excluding parity bits) 3DES [FIPS 46-3] keys the hash function SHA-1 [FIPS 180-4] SHALL be used and the following additional steps MUST be performed:

* Use octets 1 to 8 of keydata to form keydataA and octets 9 to 16 of keydata to form keydataB; additional octets are not used.
* Adjust the parity bits of keydataA and keydataB to form correct DES keys (OPTIONAL).

##### 9.7.1.2 AES

To derive 128-bit AES [FIPS 197] keys the hash function SHA-1 [FIPS 180-4] SHALL be used and the following additional step MUST be performed:

* Use octets 1 to 16 of keydata; additional octets are not used.

To derive 192-bit and 256-bit AES [FIPS 197] keys SHA-256 [FIPS 180-4] SHALL be used. For 192-bit AES keys the following additional step MUST be performed:

* Use octets 1 to 24 of keydata; additional octets are not used.

#### 9.7.2 Document Basic Access Keys

The computation of two key 3DES keys from a key seed (K) is used in the establishment of the Document Basic Access Keys KEnc = KDF(K,1) and KMAC = KDF(K,2).

#### 9.7.3 PACE

Let KDFπ(π) = KDF(f(π),3) be a key derivation function to derive encryption keys from a password π. The encoding of passwords, i.e. K= f(π) is specified in Table 14:

Table 14.    Password encodings

| Password | Encoding |
| :--- | :--- |
| MRZ | SHA-1(Document Number \|\| Date of Birth \|\| Date of Expiry) |
| CAN | [ISO/IEC 8859-1] encoded character string |

Note.— The document number to be used as input is always the complete document number. In case of TD1-documents with document numbers longer than nine characters, the document number needs to be concatenated from the document number field and the optional data field of the MRZ, excluding the filler character. See also Note j) in Section 4.2.2 in Doc 9303-5.

<!-- page 72 -->

#### 9.7.4 Secure Messaging Keys

Keys for encryption and authentication are derived with KDFEnc(K) = KDF(K,1) and KDFMAC(K) = KDF(K,2) respectively, from a shared secret K.

### 9.8 Secure Messaging

#### 9.8.1 Session Initiation

A session is started when secure messaging is established. Within a session the secure messaging keys (i.e. established by Basic Access Control, PACE or Chip Authentication) may be changed.

Secure Messaging is based on either 3DES [FIPS 46-3] or AES [FIPS 197] in encrypt-then-authenticate mode, i.e. data is padded, encrypted and afterwards the formatted encrypted data is input to the authentication calculation. The session keys SHALL be derived using the key derivation function described in Section 9.7.1.

Note.— Padding is always performed by the secure messaging layer, therefore the underlying message authentication code need not perform any internal padding.

#### 9.8.2 Send Sequence Counter

An unsigned integer SHALL be used as Send Sequence Counter (SSC). The bitsize of the SSC SHALL be equal to the blocksize of the block cipher used for Secure Messaging, i.e., 64 bit for 3DES and 128 bit for AES.

The SSC SHALL be increased every time before a command or response APDU is generated, i.e., if the starting value is x, in the first command the value of the SSC is x+1. The value of SSC for the first response is x+2.

If Secure Messaging is restarted, the SSC is used as follows:

* The commands used for key agreement are protected with the old session keys and old SSC. This applies in particular for the response of the last command used for session key agreement.
* The Send Sequence Counter is set to its new start value, see Section 9.8.6.3 for 3DES and Section 9.8.7.3 for AES.
* The new session keys and the new SSC are used to protect subsequent commands/responses.

#### 9.8.3 Session Termination

The eMRTD chip MUST abort Secure Messaging if and only if a Secure Messaging error occurs or a plain APDU is received.

If Secure Messaging is aborted, the eMRTD chip SHALL delete the stored session keys and reset the terminal’s access rights.

Note.— The eMRTD chip MAY implicitly select the Master File when a session is terminated.

<!-- page 73 -->

#### 9.8.4 Message Structure of SM APDUs

The SM Data Objects (see [ISO/IEC 7816-4]) MUST be used in the following order:

* Command APDU: [DO‘85’ or DO‘87’] [DO‘97’] DO‘8E’.
* Response APDU: [DO‘85’ or DO‘87’] [DO‘99’] DO‘8E’.

In case INS is even, DO‘87’ SHALL be used, and in case INS is odd, DO‘85’ SHALL be used.

All SM Data Objects MUST be encoded in BER TLV as specified in [ISO/IEC 7816-4]. The command header MUST be included in the MAC calculation, therefore the class byte CLA = 0x0C MUST be used.

The actual value of Lc will be modified to Lc’ after application of Secure Messaging. If required, an appropriate data object may optionally be included into the APDU data part in order to convey the original value of Lc.

Figure 5 shows the transformation of an unprotected command APDU to a protected command APDU in the case Data and Le are available. If no Data is available, leave building DO ‘87’ out. If Le is not available, leave building DO ‘97’ out. To avoid ambiguity it is RECOMMENDED not to use an empty value field of Le Data Object (see also Section 10.4 of [ISO/IEC 7816-4]).

Figure 6 shows the transformation of an unprotected response APDU to a protected response APDU in case Data is available. If no Data is available, leave building DO ‘87’ out.

#### 9.8.5 SM Errors

Abortion of the Secure Channel for the eMRTD Application occurs when:

* the contactless IC is de-powered; or
* the contactless IC recognizes an SM error while interpreting a command. In this case the status bytes must be returned without SM.

If Secure Messaging is aborted, the eMRTD chip SHALL delete the stored session keys and reset the terminal’s access rights.

Note.— There MAY be other circumstances in which the contactless IC aborts the session. It is not feasible to provide a complete list of such circumstances.

9.8.6    3DES Modes of Operation

##### 9.8.6.1 Encryption

Two key 3DES in CBC mode with zero IV (i.e. 0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00) according to [ISO/IEC 11568-2] is used. Padding according to [ISO/IEC 9797-1] padding method 2 is used.

##### 9.8.6.2 Message Authentication

Cryptographic checksums are calculated using [ISO/IEC 9797-1] MAC algorithm 3 with block cipher DES, zero IV (8 bytes), and [ISO/IEC 9797-1] padding method 2. The MAC length MUST be 8 bytes.

After a successful authentication the datagram to be MACed MUST be prepended by the Send Sequence Counter.

##### 9.8.6.3 Send Sequence Counter

For Secure Messaging following BAC, the Send Sequence Counter SHALL be initialized by concatenating the four least significant bytes of RND.IC and RND.IFD, respectively:

SSC = RND.IC (4 least significant bytes) || RND.IFD (4 least significant bytes).

In all other cases, the SSC SHALL be initialized to zero (i.e. 0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00).

#### 9.8.7 AES Modes of Operation

##### 9.8.7.1 Encryption

For message encryption AES [FIPS 197] SHALL be used in CBC-mode according to [ISO/IEC 10116] with key KSEnc and IV = E(KSEnc, SSC).

##### 9.8.7.2 Message Authentication

For message authentication AES SHALL be used in CMAC-mode [SP 800-38B] with KSMAC with a MAC length of 8 bytes. The datagram to be authenticated SHALL be prepended by the Send Sequence Counter.

##### 9.8.7.3 Send Sequence Counter

The Send Sequence Counter SHALL be initialized to zero (i.e. 0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00).

### Appendix A to Part 11 — ENTROPY OF MRZ-DERIVED ACCESS KEYS (INFORMATIVE)

Due to its simplicity Basic Access Control turned out to be a very successful protocol and it is implemented in almost every eMRP.

The security provided by Basic Access Control is limited by the design of the protocol. The Document Basic Access Keys (KEnc and KMAC) are generated from printed data with very limited randomness. The data that is used for the generation of the keys are Document Number, Date of Birth, and Date of Expiry. As a consequence the resulting keys have a relatively low entropy and are cryptographically weak. The actual entropy mainly depends on the type of the Document Number. For a 10-year valid travel document the maximum strength of the keys is approximately:

* 56 Bit for a numeric Document Number (3652 * 1012 possibilities)
* 73 Bit for an alphanumeric Document Number (3652*369*103 possibilities).

Especially in the second case this estimation requires the Document Number to be randomly and uniformly chosen which is usually not the case. Depending on the knowledge of the attacker, the actual entropy of the Document Basic Access Key may be lower, e.g. if the attacker knows all Document Numbers in use or is able to correlate Document Numbers and Dates of Expiry.

There is no straightforward way to strengthen Basic Access Control as its limitations are inherent to the design of the protocol based on symmetric (“secret key”) cryptography. A cryptographically strong access control mechanism must (additionally) use asymmetric (“public key”) cryptography.

Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) was designed to overcome this problem. It employs asymmetric cryptography to establish session keys, whose strength is independent of the entropy of the used password. If PACE is implemented with elliptic curve cryptography with 256 Bit curves and AES-128 (a common choice), the session keys have 128 Bit entropy.

Two types of attacks must be distinguished:

* Skimming: this is an online attack, i.e. the attacker tries to access the contactless IC in real time, e.g. by guessing the password. If the protocol used to protect the contactless IC has no cryptographic weakness, the success probability of the attacker is given by the time the attacker has access to the IC, the duration of a single attempt to guess the password, and the entropy of the passport.
* Eavesdropping: this is an offline attack, i.e. the attacker tries to decrypt intercepted communication without access to the contactless IC. If the protocol used to establish the session keys has no cryptographic weakness, the success probability is given by the strength of the session keys and the computing power available to the attacker.

For further information see [Keesing2009] for a general discussion on entropy of session keys and a comparison of BAC and PACE, and [BFK2009] for a cryptographic analysis of PACE.

### Appendix B to Part 11 — POINT ENCODING FOR THE ECDH-INTEGRATED MAPPING (INFORMATIVE)

#### B.1 HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF THE POINT ENCODING METHOD

The algorithm takes as inputs the curve parameters (a, b, p, f ) where (a, b) are the curve coefficients, p is the characteristic of the prime field over which the curve

E : y2 ≡ x3 + ax + b (mod p)

is defined. The order of E is always of the form fq for some prime q and f is called the co-factor. PACE v2 requires the generation of a point that belongs to the q-subgroup of E that we denote by E[q]. The point encoding also takes as input a number t such that

0 < t < p

and returns, in constant time, a point that belongs to E[q]. As described in [BCIMRT2010], point encoding comes in two flavours, depending on the coordinate system preferred by the implementation:

* A first implementation, described in Section B.2, outputs the elliptic curve point in affine coordinates (x, y);
* An alternate implementation, presented in Section B.3, outputs the same point in Jacobian coordinates (X, Y, Z).

Irrespective of the option taken, the generated point is identical in the sense that

x = XZ-2 mod p and y= YZ-3 mod p

and the implementation of the subsequent phase of PACE v2 (the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange phase) can therefore take advantage of using the option that best fits the interface of the cryptographic API that performs elliptic-curve operations.

As noted hereafter, point encoding for affine coordinates roughly requires two modular exponentiations modulo p whereas point encoding for Jacobian coordinates requires only a single one.

Note that for the two available implementations, point encoding explicitly requires that p ≡ 3 mod 4.

<!-- page 82 -->

#### B.2 IMPLEMENTATION FOR AFFINE COORDINATES

The algorithm is implemented as follows: Inputs: curve parameters (a, b, p, f ) and t such that 0 < t < p Output: a point (x, y) in the prime-order subgroup E[q] of E

1. Compute α = -t2 mod p 2. Compute X2 = -ba-1(1+(α+α2) -1) mod p 3. Compute X3 = α X2 mod p 4. Compute h2 = (X2)3+ a X2 + b mod p 5. Compute h3 = (X3)3+ a X3 + b mod p 6. Compute U = t3 h2 mod p 7. Compute A = (h2) p-1-(p+1)/4 mod p 8. If A2 h2=1 mod p define (x, y) = (X2, A h2 mod p) 9. Otherwise define (x, y) = (X3, A U mod p) 10. Output (x, y) = [f] (x, y).

Implementation Notes

Neglecting modular multiplications and additions, the execution time of the above implementation is dominated by two modular exponentiations:

* Step 2 can be rewritten

X2 = -ba-1(1+(α+α2) -1) = -b(1+α+α2) (a(α+α2)) p-2 mod p

which essentially amounts to a modular exponentiation with exponent p-2;

* Step 7 is a modular exponentiation with exponent p-1-(p+1)/4.

Note.— Step 10 requires a scalar multiplication by the co-factor f. For many curves, the co-factor is equal to 1 so that this scalar multiplication can be avoided.

#### B.3 IMPLEMENTATION FOR JACOBIAN COORDINATES

The algorithm is implemented as follows:

Inputs: curve parameters (a, b, p, f) and t such that 0 < t < p

Output: a point (X, Y, Z) in the prime-order subgroup E[q] of E

1. Compute α = -t2 mod p 2. Compute Ζ = a(α+α2) mod p 3. Compute X2 = -bΖ (1+α+α2) mod p 4. Compute X3 = α X2 mod p 5. Compute h2 = (X2)3+ a X2 Z4+ b Z6 mod p 6. Compute h3 = (X3)3+ a X3 Z4 + b Z6 mod p 7. Compute U = -α t h2 mod p 8. Compute A = (h2) p-1-(p+1)/4 mod p 9. If A2 h2=1 mod p define (X, Y, Z) = (X2, A h2 mod p, Z) 10. Otherwise define (X, Y, Z) = (X3, A U mod p, Z) Output (X, Y, Z) = [f]( X, Y, Z ).

<!-- page 83 -->

Implementation Notes

Neglecting modular multiplications and additions, the execution time of the above implementation is dominated by the single modular exponentiation of Step 7. Therefore, it is expected to be roughly twice as fast as the implementation for affine coordinates.

Note.— The scalar multiplication in Step 10 can be completely avoided when the co-factor f is equal to 1.

### Appendix C to Part 11 — CHALLENGE SEMANTICS (INFORMATIVE)

Consider a signature based challenge-response protocol between an eMRTD chip (IC) and a terminal (IFD), where the eMRTD chip wants to prove knowledge of its private key SKIC:

* The terminal sends a randomly chosen challenge c to the eMRTD chip.
* The eMRTD chip responds with the signature s=Sign(SKIC,c).

While this is a very simple and efficient protocol, the eMRTD chip in fact signs the message c without knowing the semantic of this message. As signatures provide a transferable proof of authenticity, any third party can – in principle – be convinced that the eMRTD chip has indeed signed this message.

Although c should be a random bit string, the terminal can as well generate this bit string in an unpredictable but (publicly) verifiable way, e.g., let SKIFD be the terminal’s private key and

c = Sign(SKIFD,IDIC||Date||Time||Location)

be the challenge generated by using a signature scheme with message recovery. The signature guarantees that the terminal has indeed generated this challenge. Due to the transferability of the terminal’s signature, any third party having trust in the terminal and knowing the corresponding public key PKIFD can check that the challenge was created correctly by verifying this signature. Furthermore, due to the transferability of eMRTD chip’s signature on the challenge, the third party can conclude that the assertion became true: The eMRTD chip was indeed at a certain date and time at a certain location.

On the positive side, States may use Challenge Semantics for their internal use, e.g., to prove that a certain person indeed has immigrated. On the negative side such proofs can be misused to track persons. In particular since Active Authentication is not restricted to authorized terminals, misuse is possible. The worst scenario would be eMRTD chips that provide Active Authentication without Basic Access Control. In this case a very powerful tracking system may be set up by placing secure hardware modules at prominent places. The resulting logs cannot be faked due to the signatures. Basic Access Control diminishes this problem to a certain extent, as interaction with the bearer is required. Nevertheless, the problem remains, but is restricted to places where the travel document of the bearer is read anyway, e.g., by airlines or hotels.

One might object that especially in a contactless scenario, challenges may be eavesdropped and reused at a different date, time or location and thus render the proof at least unreliable. While eavesdropping challenges are technically possible, the argument is still invalid. By assumption a terminal is trusted to produce challenges correctly, and it can be assumed that it has checked the eMRTD chip’s identity before starting Active Authentication. Thus, the eavesdropped challenge will contain an identity different from the identity of the prover who signs the challenge.

### Appendix E to Part 11 — WORKED EXAMPLE: PASSIVE AUTHENTICATION (INFORMATIVE)

Step 1. Read the Document Security Object (SOD) (optionally containing the Document Signer Certificate (CDS)) from the contactless IC.

Step 2: Read the Document Signer (DS) from the Document Security Object (SOD).

Step 3: The inspection system verifies SOD by using Document Signer Public Key.

Step 4: The inspection system verifies CDS by using the Country Signing CA Public Key.

If both verifications in step 3 and 4 are correct, then this ensures that the contents of SOD can be trusted and can be used in the inspection process.

Step 5: Read the relevant Data Groups from the LDS.

Step 6: Calculate the hashes of the relevant Data Groups.

Step 7: Compare the calculated hashes with the corresponding hash values in the SOD.

If the hash values in step 7 are identical, this ensures that the contents of the Data Group are authentic and unchanged.

### Appendix F to Part 11 — WORKED EXAMPLE: ACTIVE AUTHENTICATION (INFORMATIVE)

This worked example uses the following settings:

1. Integer factorization-based mechanism: RSA

2. Modulus length (k):

1 024 bits (128 bytes)

3. Hash algorithm:

SHA-1

Inspection system:

Step 1.

Generate an 8 byte random:

RND.IFD = ‘F173589974BF40C6’

Step 2.

Construct command for internal authenticate and send command APDU to the eMRTD’s

contactless IC:

Command APDU

| CLA | INS | P1 | P2 | Lc | Command data field | Le |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 00 | 88 | 00 | 00 | 08 | RND.IFD | 00 |

eMRTD’s contactless IC:

Step 3.

Determine M2 from incoming APDU:

M2 = ‘F173589974BF40C6’

Step 4.

Create the trailer:

T = ‘BC’ (i.e. SHA-1)

t (length of T in octets) = 1

Step 5.

Determine lengths:

a. c = k – Lh – 8t – 4 = 1024 – 160 – 8 – 4 = 852 bits

b. LM1 = c – 4 = 848 bits

Step 6.

Generate nonce M1 of length LM1:

M1 = ‘9D2784A67F8E7C659973EA1AEA25D95B

6C8F91E5002F369F0FBDCE8A3CEC1991

6E86F5C71AEA978264C4A207446DAD4E

7292E2DCDA3024B47DA8’

<!-- page 100 -->

Step 7.

Create M:

M = M1 | M2 =‘9D2784A67F8E7C659973EA1AEA25D95B

6C8F91E5002F369F0FBDCE8A3CEC1991

7292E2DCDA3024B47DA8F173589974BF

40C6’

Step 8.

Calculate SHA-1 digest of M:

H = SHA-1(M) = ‘C063AA1E6D22FBD976AB0FE73D94D2D9

C6D88127’

Step 9.2 Construct the message representative:

F = ‘6A’ | M1 | H | T =

‘6A9D2784A67F8E7C659973EA1AEA25D9

5B6C8F91E5002F369F0FBDCE8A3CEC19

22FBD976AB0FE73D94D2D9C6D88127BC’

Step 10. Encrypt F with the Active Authentication Private Key to form the signature:

S =  ‘756B683B036A6368F4A2EB29EA700F96

E26100AFC0809F60A91733BA29CAB362

6923B2C43437800BBC9BC028C49806CF

2E47D16AE2B2CC1678F2A4456EF98FC9’

Step 11. Construct response data for INTERNAL AUTHENTICATE and send response APDU to the

inspection system:

Response APDU:

| Response data field | SW1-SW2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| S | 9000 |

2. Since the known part (RND.IFD) is not returned, but must be appended by the IFD itself, Partial Recovery applies (‘6A’).

<!-- page 101 -->

Inspection system:

Step 12. Decrypt the signature with the public key:

F = ‘6A9D2784A67F8E7C659973EA1AEA25D9

5B6C8F91E5002F369F0FBDCE8A3CEC19

4E7292E2DCDA3024B47DA8C063AA1E6D

22FBD976AB0FE73D94D2D9C6D88127BC’

Step 13. Determine hash algorithm by trailer T*:

T = ‘BC’ (i.e. SHA-1)

Step 14. Extract digest:

D =  ‘C063AA1E6D22FBD976AB0FE73D94D2D9

C6D88127’

Step 15. Extract M1:

M1 =‘9D2784A67F8E7C659973EA1AEA25D95B

6C8F91E5002F369F0FBDCE8A3CEC1991

6E86F5C71AEA978264C4A207446DAD4E

7292E2DCDA3024B47DA8’

Step 16. Header indicates partial recovery but signature has modulus length so concatenate M1 with

known M2 (i.e. RND.IFD):

M* = ‘9D2784A67F8E7C659973EA1AEA25D95B

6С8F91E5002F369F0FBDCE8A3СEС1991

7292E2DCDA3024B47DA8F173589974BF

40C6’

Step 17. Calculate SHA-1 digest of M*:

D* = ‘C063AA1E6D22FBD976AB0FE73D94D2D9

C6D88127’

Step 18. Compare D and D*:

D is equal to D* so verification successful.

### Appendix G to Part 11 — WORKED EXAMPLE: PACE – GENERIC MAPPING (INFORMATIVE)

This appendix provides two worked examples for the PACE protocol as defined in Section 4.4 using the generic mapping. The first example is based on ECDH while the second one uses DH. All numbers contained in the tables are noted hexadecimal.

In both examples, the MRZ is used as password. This also leads to the same symmetric key Kπ. The relevant data fields of the MRZ including the check digits are:

* Document Number: T220001293;
* Date of Birth: 6408125;
* Date of Expiry: 1010318.

Hence, the encoding K of the MRZ and the derived encryption key Kπ are

| K | 7E2D2A41 C74EA0B3 8CD36F86 3939BFA8 E9032AAD |
| :--- | :--- |
| K<br>π | 89DED1B2 6624EC1E 634C1989 302849DD |

#### G.1 ECDH BASED EXAMPLE

This example is based on ECDH applying the standardized BrainpoolP256r1 domain parameters (see [RFC 5639]).

The first section introduces the corresponding PACEInfo. Subsequently, the exchanged APDUs including all generated nonces and ephemeral keys are listed and examined.

Elliptic Curve Parameters

Using standardized domain parameters, all information required to perform PACE is given by the data structure PACEInfo. In particular, no PACEDomainParameterInfo is needed.

PACEInfo 3012060A 04007F00 07020204 02020201 0202010D

Application flow of the ECDH-based example

To initialize PACE, the terminal sends the command MSE:Set AT to the chip.

| T>C : | 00 22 C1 A4 0F 80 0A 04 00 7F 00 07 02 02 04 02 02 83 01 01 |
| :--- | :--- |
| C>T : | 90 00 |

Here, T>C is an abbreviation for an APDU sent from terminal to chip while C>T denotes the corresponding response sent by the chip to the terminal. The encoding of the command is explained in the next table.

| Command |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| :--- | :--- |
| Encrypted Nonce z | 95A3A016 522EE98D 01E76CB6 B98B42C3 |

The encrypted nonce is queried by the terminal.

Perform Key Agreement

In the third step, chip and terminal perform an anonymous ECDH key agreement using the new domain parameters determined by the ephemeral group generator of the previous step. Only the x-coordinate is required as shared secret since the KDF uses only the first coordinate to derive the session keys.

The first section introduces the PACEInfo. Subsequently, the exchanged APDUs including all generated nonces and ephemeral keys are listed and examined.

Diffie Hellman Parameters

The relevant information for PACE is given by the data structure PACEInfo.

PACEInfo 3012060A 04007F00 07020204 01020201 02020100

The detailed structure of PACEInfo is:

### Appendix H to Part 11 — WORKED EXAMPLE: PACE – INTEGRATED MAPPING (INFORMATIVE)

This Appendix provides two examples for the PACE protocol with Integrated Mapping. The first one is based on Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and the second one on Diffie-Hellman (DH). The MRZ-derived key K from the previous Example is used.

#### H.1 ECDH BASED EXAMPLE

This example is based on the BrainpoolP256r1 elliptic curve. The block cipher used in this example is AES-128. For reminder, the curve parameters are the following:

### Appendix I to Part 11 — WORKED EXAMPLE: PACE – PACE CA MAPPING (INFORMATIVE)

This Appendix provides an example for the PACE protocol with Chip Authentication Mapping based on Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH). All numbers contained in the tables are noted hexadecimal.

The MRZ is used as password. The relevant data fields of the MRZ including the check digits are:

* Document Number: C11T002JM4;
* Date of Birth: 9608122;
* Date of Expiry: 2310314.

Hence, the encoding K of the MRZ and the derived encryption key Kπ are

| :--- | :--- |
| K<br>π | 4E6F6FBF 7BE748B9 32C7B741 61BBA9DF |

#### I.1 ECDH BASED EXAMPLE

This example is based on ECDH applying the standardized BrainpoolP256r1 domain parameters (see [RFC 5639]).

The first section introduces the corresponding PACEInfo. Subsequently, the exchanged APDUs including all generated nonces and ephemeral keys are listed and examined.

Elliptic Curve Parameters

Using standardized domain parameters, all information required to perform PACE is given by the data structure PACEInfo. In particular, no PACEDomainParameterInfo is needed.

PACEInfo 3012060A 04007F00 07020204 06020201 0202010D

The detailed structure of PACEInfo is itemized in the following table.

Application flow of the ECDH-based example

To initialize PACE, the terminal sends the command MSE:AT to the chip.

| T>C : | 00 22 C1 A4 0F 80 0A 04 00 7F 00 07 02 02 04 06 02 83 01 01 |
| :--- | :--- |
| C>T : | 90 00 |

Here, T>C is an abbreviation for an APDU sent from terminal to chip while C>T denotes the corresponding response sent by the chip to the terminal. The encoding of the command is explained in the next table.

Encrypted Nonce

Next, the chip randomly generates the nonce s and encrypts it by means of Kπ .

| Decrypted Nonce s | 658B860B C94DF6F0 44FCE6D5 C82CF8E5 |
| :--- | :--- |
| Encrypted Nonce z | CB60E8E0 D85B76A9 BD304747 C2AD42E2 |

The encrypted nonce is queried by the terminal.

| T>C : | 10 86 00 00 02 7C 00 00 |
| :--- | :--- |
| C>T : | 7C 12 80 10 CB 60 E8 E0 D8 5B 76 A9 BD 30 47 47 C2 AD 42 E2 90 00 |

Perform Key Agreement

In the third step, chip and terminal perform an anonymous ECDH key agreement using the new domain parameters determined by the ephemeral group generator of the previous step. Only the x-coordinate is required as shared secret since the KDF uses only the first coordinate to derive the session keys.

### Appendix J to Part 11 — INSPECTION PROCEDURES (INFORMATIVE)

#### J.1 INSPECTION PROCEDURE FOR eMRTD APPLICATION

This section describes an inspection procedure which contains only an eMRTD Application (“LDS1-documents”).

1. Gain access to the contactless IC (see Section 4.2)

* If access to the IC is protected, PACE or BAC can be used in this step, although it is recommended to use PACE for security reasons. Beginning 1/1/2018 eMRTDs may support PACE only.
* If supported by IC and terminal, PACE-CAM should be used for performance reasons.
* The IC grants access to less sensitive data in the eMRTD Application and to EF.CardSecurity in the Master File, if present.

2. Start authentication of data

* Read the Document Security Object and verify the signature, including chain verification of the Document Signer Certificate.

3. Authentication of the chip

* Depending on support by the IC, perform Chip Authentication or Active Authentication. Support of Active Authentication is indicated by the presence of EF.DG15 in the eMRTD Application, support for Chip Authentication by the presence of corresponding SecurityInfos in EF.DG14.
* This step can also be performed as part of step 1, if PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping is used.
* Authentication is only complete in combination with authentication of the file containing the public key (EF.CardSecurity, EF.DG14 or EF.DG15) used for this step.

4. Additional access control

* Performing Terminal Authentication is necessary, if the eMRTD is configured to require this for access to sensitive data, i.e. EF.DG3 and/or EF.DG4.

5. Read data

* Reading data can be started as soon as the necessary access rights are granted, e.g. less sensitive data can be read after step 1.
* Data must not be considered genuine without authentication of the read data (step 2).

<!-- page 144 -->

#### J.2 INSPECTION PROCEDURE FOR MULTI-APPLICATION eMRTDS

This section describes an inspection procedure designed for eMRTDs containing one or more applications besides the eMRTD Application (“LDS2-documents”). This procedure can also be used to access the eMRTD Application only.

1. Gain access to the contactless IC (see Section 4.2)

* In this setting, only PACE is available to gain access to the IC.
* If supported by IC and terminal, PACE-CAM should be used for performance reasons.
* The IC grants access to less sensitive data in the eMRTD Application and to EF.CardSecurity in the Master File.

2. Check presence of EF.CardSecurity

* If EF.CardSecurity is not present, the eMRTD does not support authentication in the Master File (implying that the IC only contains an eMRTD Application). In this case, select the eMRTD Application and continue with step 2 of the procedure in Section J.1 of this appendix.

3. Start authentication of data

* Read EF.CardSecurity and verify the signature, including chain verification of the Document Signer Certificate.
* Data from the eMRTD Application are protected via the Document Security Object, which must be verified when data from this application is read. Data from other applications are protected by signatures of the data, which also must be verified upon reading these data.

4. Authentication of the chip

* Perform Chip Authentication in the Master File. If the necessary information are not contained in the SecurityInfos in EF.CardSecurity, the IC does not support authentication in the Master File. In this case select the eMRTD Application and continue with step 2 of the procedure in Section J.1 of this appendix.
* This step can also be performed as part of step 1, if PACE with Chip Authentication Mapping is used.
* Authentication is only complete in combination with authentication of the file containing the public key (EF.CardSecurity) used for this step.

5. Additional access control

* Perform Terminal Authentication.
* If only read access to less sensitive data in the eMRTD Application is required, this step can be skipped.

<!-- page 145 -->

6. Reading/writing data

* Reading/writing data includes selection of the applications containing the files.
* Reading data can be started as soon as the necessary access rights are granted, e.g. less sensitive data of the eMRTD Application can be read after step 1.
* Data must not be considered genuine without authentication of the read data (step 3).

### Appendix K to Part 11 — EUROPEAN EXTENDED ACCESS CONTROL (INFORMATIVE)

Terminal Authentication as defined in this document is based on Extended Access Control as used in the European Union (see [TR-03110]) to protect access to fingerprints stored in the LDS1 application. This appendix points out the differences between [TR-03110] and the protocols defined in this document.

The Advanced Inspection Procedure used to access eMRTDs equipped with EAC according to [TR-03110] comprises the following steps:

1. Perform the Chip Access Procedure (see Section 4.2) and select the eMRTD Application;

2. Perform Chip Authentication in the eMRTD Application (see Section 6.2) and start Passive Authentication (see Section 5.1);

3. Perform Terminal Authentication (see below) in the eMRTD Application (see Section 7.1).

Note.— Both Chip and Terminal Authentication are performed in the eMRTD Application in the European Extended Access Control. The specifications in this document allow these protocols, depending on context, to be performed either in the eMRTD Application or the Master File.

#### K.1 ACCESS RIGHTS

Table K-1.    Authorization of Inspection Systems

| 7 6 | 5 4 3 2 1 0 | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| x x | - - - - - - | Role (see Doc 9303-12) |
| - - | x x x x x x | Access Rights |

| - - | - - - - - 1 | Read access to eMRTD Application: DG3 (Fingerprint) |

Access rights to data groups in applications other than the eMRTD Application are conveyed via Authorization Extensions as defined in Parts 12 and 10 of Doc 9303. Access rights for fingerprints (and iris) are conveyed via the Certificate Holder Authorization Template:

For the computation of the effective access rights, see Section 7.1.4.3.6.

<!-- page 148 -->

#### K.2 EF.CVCA

According to the specification, the trust points (Certificate Authority References) known to the IC for certificate verification as part of Terminal Authentication are transmitted to the IFD as part of the PACE protocol (see Section 4.4.3.5).

The European Extended Access Control defines a transparent file EF.CVCA in the eMRTD Application instead. The specification is reproduced below:

Table K-2.    Elementary File EF.CVCA

| File Name | EF.CVCA |
| :--- | :--- |
| File ID | 0x011C (default) |
| Short File ID | 0x1C (default) |
| Read Access | PACE |
| Write Access | NEVER (internally updated only) |
| Size | 36 bytes (fixed) padded with octets of value 0x00 |
| Content | [CARi ][\|\|CARi-1][\|\|0x00..00] |

If the IC supports Terminal Authentication in the eMRTD Application, it MUST make the references of CVCA public keys suitable for inspection systems available in a transparent elementary file EF.CVCA in the eMRTD Application as specified in Table K-2.

This file SHALL contain a sequence of Certification Authority Reference (CAR) data objects (see Doc 9303-12) suitable for Terminal Authentication.

* It SHALL contain at most two Certification Authority Reference data objects.
* The most recent Certification Authority Reference SHALL be the first data object in this list.
* The file MUST be padded by appending octets of value 0x00.

The file EF.CVCA has a default EF identifier and short EF identifier. If the default values cannot be used, the (short) EF identifier SHALL be specified in the OPTIONAL parameter efCVCA of the TerminalAuthenticationInfo. If efCVCA is used to indicate the EF identifier to be used, the default EF identifier is overridden. If no short EF identifier is given in efCVCA, the file EF.CVCA MUST be explicitly selected using the given EF identifier.

TerminalAuthenticationInfo ::= SEQUENCE { protocol OBJECT IDENTIFIER(id-TA), version  INTEGER, -- MUST be 1 efCVCA   FileID OPTIONAL }

FileID ::= SEQUENCE { fid  OCTET STRING (SIZE(2)), sfid OCTET STRING (SIZE(1)) OPTIONAL }
